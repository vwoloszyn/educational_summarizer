Still, students are often reluctant to read what many times can be a long build-up to the action they crave. Aron Ralston's book is ruminative and informative in its effort to explain how he managed to survive. Most young readers will want to skim the details about his outdoor adventures, the hikes, the climbs, and the description of terrain that is mostly unfamiliar and desolate. They will want to go quickly to the moment when Ralston falls and thus skip the reflection, fear and inspiration that finally leads him to cut off his arm and free himself mere hours from certain death. In anticipation of such reluctant readers, this lesson plan uses valuable information that Ralston conveys in his book to inform a more thorough understanding of the film.

Description of the Movie: Adapted from Aron Ralston's book, Between a Rock and a Hard Place, this 127 Hours details the harrowing time Ralston spent trying to free himself after a shifting bolder pinned his arm against the wall of a remote slot canyon in the Utah desert. The film's high energy beginning defines Ralston's character and is in stark contrast to the isolation and silence that mark the young outdoorsman's time trapped without hope of rescue.

The scene in which Aron frees himself by breaking bones and cutting through flesh is graphic and medically accurate. It may be disturbing to some students. LESSON PLAN: USING 127 HOURS IN A CLASSROOM SETTING Preparation 1.   Review the film to make sure it is suitable for the class. Obtain appropriate administrative or parental approval. 2.  Read the Student Handout set out below and select chapter summaries and assignments suitable for the class. Modify or delete sections as appropriate. For a version of the handout in word processing format, click here. Students may not have had each of the experiences referred to in the prompts for the journal entries. One way to address this is to let them pick five or six to which they can respond. Print and copy the modified handout. 3.   The lesson plan suggests that the teacher or a student who is a good reader or who is interested in drama read a quote from The Odyssey out loud to the class. If this task is assigned to a student, give the student advance warning and a copy of the passage so that he or she can practice. Presentation of the Lesson 1.   Ask if any student has seen the film and select one to introduce it to the class. When that student has finished, ask if anyone has something to add. If none of the students have seen the movie, then provide a short description of Ralston's experience. An example is set out below: This film is about a young man, an expert hiker, who went out alone to a remote area in the Utah desert. He didn't tell anyone where he was going. As he walked down a slot canyon, which is a deep narrow rift in the earth with steep rock walls on either side, his path was blocked by a large boulder. When Ralston tried to climb over the boulder it shifted and pinned his arm against the wall of the canyon. Ralston couldn't get out and he couldn't get help. He spent five days trapped between the boulder and the canyon wall. For much of the time Ralston thought he would die. He had a movie camera with him and recorded his good-bys to family and friends. After five days, Ralston discovered a way to break the bones in his arm. In a last ditch effort to survive, he cut away his flesh until he had severed his arm from the rest of his body. Ralston then stumbled out of the canyon and fortunately encountered a family that was hiking on a nearby trail. When he saw the family, Ralston collapsed. Help was summoned and Ralston was air-lifted to a hospital. 2.   Tell students that: In the front of his book, before he starts to describe himself and his experiences, Ralston quotes three verses from Homer's The Odyssey; this is the passage in which the enchantress Circe describes the dangers that Odysseus and his crew will face after they leave her island; Through these verses Ralston describes the risk of adventure, preparing the reader for the idea that there are people who love adventure for the sake of adventure itself. Then read, or have a student read, the passage out loud to the class. 3.   Describe the journal assignment. 4.   Distribute the student handout that you have reviewed and that you may have modified. 5.   Have students read the handout and complete the assigned journal entries at the end of each chapter either as in-class work or as homework. 6.   Show the film without interruption or chunked. 7.   Use the discussion questions and/or some of the journal topics to stimulate class discussion. 8.   Assign a summative essay at the end of the discussion. 9.   Collect the journal entries and the essays.",127 Hours,3,B0041KKYDI

It also introduces John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin. ","MINOR. One major historical inaccuracy in this movie should be explained. The rebels' military position and the morale of General Washington and the troops are portrayed as being very poor at the time independence was declared. This is incorrect. Before the Declaration of Independence, General Washington and the Continental Congress were optimistic about their military situation. The British Army had been driven from Boston. The rebels were busily fortifying New York against an expected British invasion. Washington had 23,000 troops and thought they could stand against the British. Of course, there were long periods when the rebels were despondent about the military situation, but this did not begin until the British routed Washington's Army at the Battle of Long Island, some seven weeks after the Declaration of Independence was signed. It doesn't make sense that the Congress would issue a Declaration of Independence unless it felt that the rebels could win. There are other distortions of the historical record which the writers obviously felt necessary to keep their audience entertained. After all, this is a musical comedy. While Franklin had his racy side, his anger at the British government and the seriousness with which he backed independence is underplayed. Martha Jefferson did not come to Philadelphia during the convention and her husband was deeply worried about her health. Most of the minor characters shown in the film as buffoons or twits were actually serious men who helped to change the world by risking their lives to create the first modern republic. Why recommend this film despite all of these inaccuracies? Because there is so much that it gets right: the resoluteness of Adams; the eloquent writing of Jefferson; the commanding presence of Franklin; the political maneuvering; and the bitter debate between North and South over slavery. All of these come through clearly. There are a few slightly off-color jokes. For example, Benjamin Franklin, referring to Jefferson, who is closeted with his recently-arrived wife and who had courted her with a violin, remarks, ""God Bless a man who can fiddle."" There are also a few jokes about the need to administer saltpeter to the troops.

Parenting Points:     Before watching the film, explain to your child how many cultures have created a story about a populist hero who is willing to risk a great deal in order to right various wrongs. Cultures also develop stories and myths to explain their origins. The story of Robin Hood is just such a myth. In 1066, almost a thousand years ago, Norman invaders from France conquered England. The people who lived in England at the time were primarily from two tribes, the Angles and the Saxons. After the conquest, the Normans became the privileged aristocrats; the Angles and Saxons were the farmers and the servants whose labor supported the expensive living style of the conquerors. Over several hundred years, the two groups began to intermarry and meld together to create the English people. Robin Hood is an Anglo-Saxon, from a former princely family of the conquered peoples. Maid Marion is a Norman. In the story, their marriage symbolizes the melding of the two groups, the Norman conquerors and the indigenous Angles and Saxons.

Available from Amazon.com. Note to Teachers: This film has many historical inaccuracies; however, it provides a compelling visual introduction the glory of ancient Alexandria; the breakdown of the belief system of the Greco-Roman civilization in the 5th century, CE; the sectarian violence that followed the rise of Christianity in Alexandria; and Hypatia, the greatest female mathematician, philosopher, astronomer and teacher of the ancient Greco-Roman civilization. The movie is also an occasion for students to learn about the Great Library/Museum, the city's knowledge industry, and Roman slavery. In addition to the its historical lessons, themes of the film include gender equality and the evils of intolerance and religious strife. Two Ways to Present the Movie:    The quick way is to provide students with the Introduction, in writing or through direct instruction, and then show the first 78 minutes of the movie or the entire film. Afterwards, have a short discussion with the class (see the suggested Discussion Questions) or have students complete an Assignment. If the whole movie is shown, be sure to review Additional Notes for Viewing the Entire Film. Consider presenting the class with the information set out in Add-ons to Link the Lesson to Later Events. The second and recommended method of presenting the film is to follow the complete lesson plan set out below. The student reports in Section 2 will enrich the experience of watching the movie and the Add-ons to Link the Lesson to Later Events will take students beyond the time of the lesson to later events. Description: The first 78 minutes of the film (until the view of the Earth after the pogrom) present a reasonable, if sometimes flawed, presentation of the topics described in the note. The remaining 42 minutes of the film veer far from the historical record. The entire movie should be used only if the misimpressions left by this part of the film receive a very strong correction. See Additional Materials for Using the Whole Film. Rationale for Using the Movie: Properly introduced, scaffolded and corrected, the film provides a vivid picture of the topics described in the Note above. This knowledge is essential to an understanding of the arc of the history of the West. The movie and the comparison with the historical record can also provide an excellent opportunity for the study of historical fiction, the changes in attitudes toward gender in Western Civilization, and the dangers of intolerance and communal strife. Cross-Curricular Opportunities: This film can be used to link history with the following areas of instruction: astronomy, women's studies, humanities, and religion. For astronomy, see TWM's Snippet Lesson Plan on the Historical Evolution of Views About the Solar System and the Retrograde Motion of Mars Using Film Clips from Agora and Internet Animations. For women's studies note that Hypatia was probably the most accomplished female mathematician, philosopher, astronomer, and educator in the Greco-Roman World. Consider studying her in depth. (See the Introduction, the minimum information to be included in a student report and the Supplemental Materials for information on Hypatia.) Humanities classes can focus on the city of Alexandria and its library-knowledge industry. The communal strife that roiled Alexandria as the Christians confronted first the Pagans, then Christians with unorthodox beliefs, and then the Jews will provide an added dimension to religion classes. Objectives/Student Outcomes Using this Lesson Plan: Students will retain striking visual images and have increased retention of a pivotal period in Western history and the other subjects of the film described in the Note. They will be exposed to important themes of gender equality and tolerance. Through the correction of the historical inaccuracies in the movie, students will also become involved in the analysis of a work of historical fiction.

Read the Helpful Background section so that you can talk a little about Huey Long's career. Ask and answer the Quick Discussion Question, go through the other Discussion Questions. The novel, All the King's Men, is a classic of American literature. While the film is based on the book, it doesn't diminish the experience of reading the novel. In fact, the film serves as an excellent introduction to the book for most children. If a child 15 years or older has good reading skills and likes the movie, suggest that he or she read the novel. It will pay real dividends. This is a situation in which a film can lead to reading, as it did for the authors' son who was going through a stage when he was not reading many books.

Description:    This movie describes the experiences of Fievel Mousekewitz, a mouse who emigrates from Russia to the United States in 1885. The experience of Fievel and his friends and family parallel the experience of millions of Europeans who emigrated to the U.S. between 1880 and 1924. Benefits of the Movie: ""An American Tail"" introduces the concept of immigration and some of the difficulties that immigrants face in a new land. For the millions of children whose families trace their origin to Eastern Europe, the film can serve as an introduction to their own heritage. Before Watching the Movie: The immigrant mice talk about how the streets in the U.S. are ""paved with cheese."" Prepare the class for this moment by telling students that in the late 1800s and early 1900s, more than a hundred years ago, millions of people came to the United States from all across Europe. They were looking for a new life in which they would have more freedom and could earn a better living for their families. They came by boat because in those days there were no airplanes. The rumor was that the streets in America were ""paved with gold."" Show the class Europe, the Atlantic Ocean, and the U.S. on a globe or a map. See, for example, Map of the North Atlantic. Point out some of the different countries of Europe, including Russia, Germany, France, and Great Britain. Then point out the location of Minsk (where the journey started), Hamburg (port of embarkation in Europe) and New York (destination in the U.S.). Trace or draw the route taken by immigrants across the Atlantic Ocean. At the point that the mice talk about how the streets in the U.S. are ""paved with cheese,"" stop the film and ask the class what they just heard. Most students will make the connection. Allow a student who understands the reference to describe it to the class.   LEARNING GUIDE MENU Benefits of the Movie Possible Problems Playing for Growth Talking for Growth Story Time Building Vocabulary Discussion Questions --- Social-Emotional Learning --- Moral-Ethical Emphasis       (Character Counts) Bridges to Reading Links to the Internet Selected Awards & Cast Possible Problems:     None.   Playing for Growth: 1.  After the movie, show how far the immigrants from Europe had to travel. See Map of the North Atlantic. Print out some outline maps and draw Fievel's journey or the journeys of your family's ancestors. Compare the trip Fievel and the immigrants made to a trip your family has taken. Describe how hard travel was at the time. There were no airplanes. The immigrants had little money, so they had to go in the lower decks of ships with many people crowded together. 2.  In the movie, mice came from countries all around the world, but specifically Russia, Italy, and Ireland. Find these on a map and trace the route to New York. 3.  Look at pictures of your family, and talk to your child about what countries they were from. Trace the journeys of your own ancestors in a different color, on the same map as before. Compare them; ask how they are the same, and how they are different. You can also print out a map of the United States and draw where members of your family have lived in America. 4.  Find pictures online of the Statue of Liberty. See, for example, Statue of Liberty Gallery. Talk about how it symbolizes freedom for many immigrants. Talk about other symbols of freedom (the flag, the Liberty Bell, etc.) and look at pictures together online or in a book. Color them together using blank coloring sheets. See Papajan.com. 5.  Build a ship from cardboard boxes, couch cushions, blankets, or whatever else your child thinks up. Pretend to be the Mousekewitz family, tossing and turning out on the ocean. When you ""land"" explore your surroundings pretending you've never seen it before. Have a mouse-like snack of cheese, crackers, and apples. 6.  If you have any family heirlooms in the house (whether they are used every day or brought out for special occasions) point them out to your child and explain how they came into the family. Talk about how important they are to you, just like Fievel's hat was to him. 7.  Make a family tree using one of the templates suggested on Kids Central Family Tree web page or make your own. Or you can draw a simple tree with branches on a piece of paper. Then add your child's name at the very top. Work down, adding siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles. You can simply write their names or do a stick-figure drawing, or you can use real photographs. Share your family's history, talking about where they came from, when they came to the U.S., and any name changes, etc. Convey as much history in these descriptions as possible. ADVERTISEMENT   If you engage in two or three of these activities, you'll be doing great! During the movie: If there is a natural breaking point in the movie,you can stop it and then offer one or two specific questions: ""What do you think will happen next?"" or you can help your child recap the highlights of the first part of the film before viewing the second. When the mice are climbing up the rope into the ship, mention that mice often get on ships by climbing up the ropes that attach the ships to shore. Sailors now put metal collars on the ropes to try to stop this. When the mice get seasick, talk to your child about motion sickness and tell them that often people get seasick when they go on ocean voyages. It's really bad when there is a storm and the boat rocks back and forth. You might want to mention that Fievel wouldn't have gotten lost if he had obeyed his dad. When someone offers to sell the immigrants the Brooklyn Bridge and a train ticket that had only been used once -- mention that many people tried to take advantage of the immigrants. No one can buy a bridge, the government owns it. A train ticket that has been used once is worthless. For more activities, see Ideas for Playing and Talking -- Developmental and Educational Advancement for Children 3 to 8. Talking for Growth The themes of this movie include: 1. ""Never say never"" means to always keep trying; 2. It's important to stand up for yourself; 3. Different people can still be friends; 4. Immigration is an important part of American history; 5. Everyone feels lost and lonely sometimes. ""Never say never"" means to always keep trying. 1.  Who showed courage in the movie? How? Talking about it: Fievel showed courage by never giving up hope. He never stopped looking for his family. The immigrants showed courage by leaving their homes behind in search of a better life. The mice in America showed courage by standing up to the cats and fighting back. It's important to stand up for yourself. 2.  Why were the mice so angry at the cats? Why did the mice think it was important to fight back? Talking about it: The mice were angry at the cats because the cats were bullying them. The cats wouldn't let the mice live peacefully and were constantly harassing them. Imagine someone making you so scared that you couldn't leave your house. That would really be upsetting! By fighting back, the mice were standing up for themselves. 3.  How did Fievel save the mice? Can kids really save the day? Talking about it: Fievel was very smart and thought up the ""Giant Mouse of Minsk,"", which saved the mice from the cats. Fievel, his friends, and his community, were able to triumph. Even though kids might be small, and sometimes adults don't listen, they can be heroes. Different people can still be friends. 4.  When Fievel first comes to America, he doesn't know anybody, but soon he meets lots of very good friends. Who are they? Talking about it: Fievel first meets Henri, the pigeon, who tells him to ""never say never"" and gives Fievel hope that he will find his family. Fievel also meets Tony, Bridget,f and Tiger. 5.  Are Fievel's friends different from each other? Are they different from him? Talking about it: Yes. They are all different in the ways that show on the outside, like being a mouse or a cat. However, when people are friends, the differences that show on the outside aren't as important as the things they have in common, such as caring for each other, liking each other, liking the same games, and having interests in common. Tiger and Fievel sing a song about this. Immigration is an important part of American history. 6.  If your family has a European heritage, tell your child that his or her ancestors came to the United States on ships like those shown in the movie. If family members were processed through Ellis Island, look at websites about Ellis Island. If the experience in your family was different, tell your family's story. For example, African-American parents can talk about the difference in the route, the fact that the slaves did not come freely, the terrible conditions in the lower decks of the slave ships, the high death rate during the ""middle passage"", and, the lack of freedom when the slaves landed in the Americas. 7.  Why did the Mousekewitz family have to change their names when they came to America? (Fievel was called Filly and Tanya became Tilly.)? Talking about it: When immigrants started coming to America from all over the world, many of them changed their names, and many names were changed by immigration officials. There are many reasons behind this, but explain that this doesn't typically happen anymore. Talk about any family names in your lineage that may have been changed. 8.   Why were the immigrant mice so happy when they thought that there were ""no cats in America""? Talking about it: The mice thought they would be free from the terrible cats. It turned out that there were cats in America, too. In real life, many immigrants believed that America was a land of riches and freedom where they would escape from the problems they had experienced in the countries they were coming from. But in reality, people faced similar struggles in America. The Mousekewitz family learned this when they encountered their first cat. But there was a difference. In America, immigrants were able to band together and protect themselves (like the mice did in this story) or use the law to stop people who were going to oppress them. This had been much harder to do in the countries they had left. Everyone feels lost and lonely sometimes. 9.  If your child remembers a family move, ask: ""How did it make you feel? Were you lonely? Were you scared of all of the new places and new people?"" Talking about it: Talk about what happened to Fievel when he moved. Eventually, he found friends and his family. Talk about some times you have moved yourself, and how different and scary a place can be at first, but after you have explored you found fun things and good friends. 10.  Have you ever been lost? How did that make you feel? Talking about it: Children will probably talk about feeling scared, worried, frightened or nervous. Talk about how even if they are lost, families and friends will always be looking for them, just like Fievel's mom, dad and sister. Reassure them that people taking care of them will always find them. ADVERTISEMENT   If you talk to your child about two or three of these topics, you'll be doing great! Encourage open-ended discussion and child-initiated questions. You might open with a general question like ""How did you like the movie? Did you have a favorite part?"" or ""Was there anything that confused or surprised you?"" Are you concerned that time will be wasted if you are absent from class? Worry no more  .  .  .   Check out TeachWithMovies' Set-Up-the-Sub. Introduce students to the cinematic and theatrical techniques used by filmmakers.

Here is an example of how you can build history into the story of a family name change. This story is for kids in the older age range for this movie. It involves immigrants who came from Russia, just like Fievel and his family. In Russia the last name for our family was Ziv. In about 1900 there were eight brothers in the family. Russia at the time was ruled by a king called the Tsar. The Tsars were brutal rulers who often didn't care about their people. The Tsar's army would draft young men for 20 years. The Tsar didn't take care of his soldiers, and men taken into the army often never came home. The Zivs didn't want to lose their sons to the Tsar's army. Two of the eight brothers were sent to America to see if it was a good place to live. When they came back to tell the family about the U.S., they couldn't use their real names because they were on the list of young men who had failed to report for duty in the army. They had to think up a new name. The name they chose was ""Frieden"", which means ""peace"" in German. They figured this was a good name for men trying to stay out of an army. Their ruse worked, and today there are well over a hundred ancestors of the Ziv family living under the name ""Frieden"" in the United States. The irony of the story is that during the Second World War, some Friedens signed up to serve in the U.S. armed forces. So, the U.S. had soldiers and sailors with a name that means peace. Story Time Retell the story at bedtime, on a rainy day, or at any quiet time. Feel free to add different things that happened to Fievel and his friends during their adventures, or afterwards. You can also talk more about the Mousekewitz family's life in the ""old country"" or their voyage to America. Ask your child to tell you a story about Tiger, Tony or Bridget. You could also talk about what Fievel's sister Tilly did while Fievel was missing. Here is a suggestion for another story to tell: Many months after Fievel found his family, he and his sister Tilly were walking down the street. They heard a tiny voice crying, and they peeked into a corner off of the street. There was a little mouse, wiping away tears. Fievel asked him his name and what was wrong. The little mouse said, ""My name is William and my family and I just arrived from England. We were walking through the market when I got lost. And now I can't find them!"" William began to cry again. Fievel remembered how bad he felt when he got lost and gave William a hug. Then he said, ""Come with us, we'll help you find your mom and dad!"" William smiled, and the three little mice started walking through the market. After awhile, it began to get dark. William became sad again, and started to cry. ""I'm never going to find my mum and dad! I'm never, never, ever going to find my family again!"" Fievel and Tilly hugged William again and said, ""Never say never!"" They walked through the street faster and faster, calling out for William's parents. All of a sudden, they heard two British voices calling ""William? Willy? William . . . where are you?"" Fievel, Tilly and William ran toward the voices, and sure enough, it was William's mom and dad. They scooped him up and gave him lots of hugs and kisses. ""We were looking all over for you!"" they said. Looking down, they saw Fievel and Tilly. ""And who are these new friends?"" ""I'm Fievel, but some people call me Filly,"" Fievel said. ""I'm Tilly,"" Tilly said. William's dad smiled, ""Well, look at that! Filly, Tilly and Willy! You'll be friends forever!"" They all laughed. William's mom gave him a big kiss and said, ""Oh, William, I was worried we'd never find you!"" William grinned and said, ""Never say never!""   Social-Emotional Learning Discussion Questions: COURAGE See question at Theme Topic #1. FRIENDSHIP See question at Theme Topic #3.   Character Counts Discussion Questions: Discussion Questions Relating to Ethical Issues will facilitate the use of this film to teach ethical principles and critical viewing. Additional questions are set out below. RESPONSIBILITY (Do what you are supposed to do; Persevere: keep on trying!; Always do your best; Use self-control; Be self-disciplined; Think before you act -- consider the consequences; Be accountable for your choices) 1.  What would have happened to Fievel if he had not listened to the Henri (the French pigeon) who told him to ""never say never again""? What does ""never say never"" mean? Talking about it: He probably would not have found his family. He would have been sad and lonely. But by never giving up, he not only helped to save the mice, but he was reunited with his family again. ""Never say never"" means to always keep trying, to never say that you can never do something. It means to never give up. 2.  The cats were bigger and more powerful than the mice, but what happened when the mice challenged them? Talking about it: The mice won. By standing up for themselves, they made a better life in America. They all worked together and managed to beat the cats, and make their world a better place. FAIRNESS (Play by the rules; Take turns and share; Be open-minded; listen to others; Don't take advantage of others; Don't blame others carelessly) 3.  Were the cats being fair to the mice? Talking about it: No. They bullied the mice and were very mean to them. The mice were very scared and were living very unhappy lives. But when the mice decided to stand up to the cats, they won. 4.  Why did the cats dress up as mice? Talking about it: They were trying to trick the mice. This was not very fair, and eventually Fievel discovered their secret and shared it with all the other mice. Together, they beat the cats and won their freedom. CARING (Be kind; Be compassionate and show you care; Express gratitude; Forgive others; Help people in need) 5.  Did Fievel's family ever stop caring for him? Did he ever stop caring for his family? Talking about it: No. Fievel's family never stopped caring for Fievel, and when they thought he was dead, they were very sad. Sometimes they got discouraged, but they always kept looking. Tilly kept their spirits up and encouraged them to never give up hope that Fievel would return. Fievel always cared for his family and never stopped trying to find them. Even when he was very sad and wanted to give up, he remembered to ""never say never"" and kept searching. Families never stop caring for each other; no matter if someone is lost, if they have a fight, or if they move to separate places. 6.  Lots of characters in the story helped Fievel when he got to America. Name them and tell me how they helped Fievel. Talking about it: The first character to help Fievel when he came to America was Henri, the pigeon who gave him good advice. Warren T. Rat also ""helped"" Fievel, but was really trying to trick him. Luckily, Fievel trusted his instincts and ran away with his new friend Tony. Tony and Bridget also helped Fievel by trying to find his family. Finally, Tiger helped Fievel, and they became very good friends. 7.  Who did Fievel help? Why is it important to help people (or animals)? Talking about it: Fievel helped all of the mice by coming up with the Giant Mouse of Minsk. Helping people (and animals) is important because it shows that you care, it is a good deed, and it helps out your community. We depend upon many people in our lives. As we get older, many people will depend on us. It would be awfully lonely if there weren't any people to depend upon or who depended on us.   Teachwithmovies.com is a Character Counts ""Six Pillars Partner"" and uses The Six Pillars of Character to organize ethical principles.

Post-Viewing Enrichment Worksheet for Amistad The Africans on board the Amistad had been seized and transported to Cuba, a Spanish territory, after Spain had outlawed the slave trade. The holding of the Supreme Court at the end of the trial was based on the law of Spain. The Court stated that: . . . They are natives of Africa, and were kidnapped there, and were unlawfully transported to Cuba, in violation of the laws and treaties of Spain, and the most solemn edicts and declarations of that government. By those laws, and treaties, and edicts, the African slave trade is utterly abolished; the dealing in that trade is deemed a heinous crime; and the Negroes thereby introduced into the dominions of Spain, are declared to be free. The Amistad, 40 U.S. 518, 593. The right of insurrection is a natural right of all men. It is the right to rise up and throw off an evil regime, and more broadly, to take violent action against oppressors. The right of insurrection is recognized in the Declaration of Independence: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness -- That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its Foundation on such Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. The Supreme Court recognized the captives' right of insurrection and rejected the claim that they were pirates or murderers: If then, these negroes are not slaves, but are kidnapped Africans, who, by the laws of Spain itself, are entitled to their freedom, and were kidnapped and illegally carried to Cuba, and illegally detained and restrained on board the Amistad; there is no pretence to say, that they are pirates or robbers. We may lament the dreadful acts, by which they asserted their liberty, and took possession of the Amistad, and endeavored to regain their native country; but they cannot be deemed pirates or robbers in the sense of the law of nations... The Amistad, 40 U.S. 518, 593 & 594. Question 1: What irony can be found in the fact that the courts issued this decision at a time when slavery remained legal in the U.S.? The case of the Amistad had lasting effects on the United States for at least two reasons. Once it was recognized that the Amistad Africans had the same rights as anyone to freedom, to return to their families, and to revolt against their enslavers, the question then arose: ""How are these black people, born in Africa, any different from black people born into slavery in the United States?"" The obvious answer was that an accident of birth should make no difference at all. Once it was admitted that the Amistad Africans had the right to their freedom, there was no logical justification for the continued enslavement of blacks in the United States. Dramatically brought to the public's attention by the Amistad incident, this logic turned many in the North against slavery. But abolitionists were still not a majority. That didn't happen until sometime during the Civil War. Question 2: Although the arguments of the abolitionists, as demonstrated by the case of the Amistad Africans are logical and compelling, the U.S. had to fight a bitter civil war to end slavery. What may be some of the reasons people in the North might have wanted to continue the practice of slavery? The second lasting effect of the Amistad incident was that the committee of abolitionists formed to defend and care for the Amistad Africans stayed together. After the captives returned to Africa, the committee sent a mission to Christianize them and other Africans. The committee developed into the American Missionary Association (""AMA"") when it merged with two other missionary antislavery societies in 1846. For the next hundred years, the AMA sought to enhance educational opportunities for blacks and other minorities in the United States. After 1850, the AMA focused primarily on abolitionist activities. During the Civil War the AMA opened schools for slaves freed by the Union Armies. These schools were open to all students and often operated as integrating institutions during Reconstruction. As the South recovered from the effects of the war and developed public school systems, the AMA gave its elementary and secondary schools, numbering more than 500, to state and local governments. It then concentrated on improving and expanding colleges for blacks in the South. Ten predominantly black colleges arose from the AMA's efforts: Atlanta University, Berea College, Dillard University, Fisk University, Hampton Institute (now Hampton University), Howard University, Huston-Tillotson College, Le Moyne College, Talladega College, and Tougaloo College. The AMA also conducted educational and other social programs for Native Americans, Asians, and migrant laborers. Question 3: Religion played a significant role in achieving freedom for slaves and assisting former slaves and black Americans as a whole to build a decent life. What do you recall from your study of the Civil Rights Movement that indicates how the impact of churches remains important in the advance of black Americans? Although the film does a fine job of illustrating the issues and beliefs leading to the Civil War, it commits an historical error in the unduly harsh portrayal of the abolitionist movement. The abolitionists were serious forward-looking people. History has proved that they were right to protest a barbaric and inhumane institution. Yet in the film, abolitionists are shown praying and singing religious songs outside of the Africans' prison. The implication is that they should have been doing something to help the captives. Their actions are portrayed as trivial. However, these abolitionists were ""bearing witness."" Their purpose was to awaken the conscience of the country to the sin of slavery as well as to the plight of the Amistad Africans. ""Bearing witness"" has been an important part of any movement for social change from biblical times to the present. This power and honorable history of bearing witness is not only missed in the film, it is denigrated. Another error lies in the fact that there is no basis to believe that Mr. Arthur Tappan, an historical figure, wanted the Amistad Africans sacrificed for the benefit of the abolitionist movement. The scene in which he proposes this was, most certainly, placed in the film to raise the question of whether the ends justify the means. Arthur Tappan 's life was devoted to freeing slaves. Both Tappan and his brother faced serious consequences, sometimes violent, from their anti-slavery activities. Lewis Tappan's dry-goods store and Arthur's home were attacked by angry pro-slavery mobs. Both men had a price on their heads in the South and on one occasion a slave's ear was found in Arthur's mailbox.",Amistad,17,0783231202

Pre-Viewing Enrichment Worksheet for Animal Farm Before 1991 the Communist ideology and the Soviet Union were considered major threats to the Western democracies. Billions of dollars were spent in what is generally known as ""The Cold War"" to both defeat communism and to establish capitalism as the dominating economic force in the world. Skirmishes erupted into actual warfare in this intense competition between the two systems of governing, most notably in Korea and Vietnam, and threatened nuclear confrontation in Cuba. But, in the end, the Soviet Union collapsed under the weight of its own inefficiency and its endemic corruption. In Animal Farm, Orwell demonstrates the pattern of corruption seen in many well-intended revolutions around the world that eventually led to the demise of the Russian Communist system. Communist social philosophy was developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in the 19th century in response to the vast inequities of industrialization and the excesses of capitalism. Working conditions were terrible; factory workers were paid little, and their lives were harsh; many factory owners amassed great wealth and lived like kings. Communism became a potent worldwide force in 1917 when adherents to its theories, the Bolsheviks, took power in Russia and created the Soviet Union. In brief, communism is an economic and political system in which all of the factories, farms, real estate and other means of economic production are owned and controlled by the community for the benefit of all. Each person is supposed to work according to his or her ability and to receive benefits from society according to his or her needs. Theoretically, in the ultimate stages of the development of society, government would become unnecessary as the community would govern itself. In reality, however, communism has been associated with dictatorial regimes that suppress individualism and civil liberties while concentrating power in the hands of authority, all at great cost to the masses of people. Question 1: How would people have to behave for a society with no government to work? Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Communism has been abandoned by most governments and is no longer considered a threat to the Western democracies. China remains a communist country in name only, but capitalism reigns in its economy, and the country operates freely within the system of international capitalism. China is beginning to develop a strong middle class and allow its people to express their individuality is some ways. However, it is an open question of whether China will go so far as to allow Western style civil liberties. Communism is in direct contrast in terms of values and mode of operation to capitalism, the economic system used by most of the world's democracies. Capitalism is a system in which the means of production and distribution are privately owned and are managed for profit. The exchange of goods and services takes place through a free market system governed by supply and demand. The United States and most countries in the World have modified capitalism by imposing government regulation on the production of goods and services and on the markets when necessary to ensure the public welfare. Examples of these regulations are the wage and hour laws, health and safety codes, antitrust laws, and product liability law suits. Socialism is an economic system, used to some degree by democracies, in which the most important means of production, as well as the means of distribution of goods and services, are owned by the state and managed for the welfare of society as a whole. In a socialist state, for example, the natural resources, factories, large farms, the banking system, and the markets would be owned and operated by the state. Socialism, like communism, was caused in part by a reaction to the vast inequalities of wealth that existed in capitalist Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries. Some aspects of the socialist system have been, to varying degrees, adopted in Europe and the United States to protect people from the excesses of capitalism. In the U.S., these include welfare which provides income assistance for the destitute; national retirement plans such as Social Security; medical care (limited to the poor and the elderly in the U.S. but provided for all members of society in most democracies); unemployment insurance; the U.S. Postal Service; the public school system; municipal electric power companies, and other special agencies such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and stores in some states that sell liquor. Question 2: What would your life be like without a public school system? The consensus in the United States and western democracies is that the most efficient form of economic organization is a modified capitalism in which most of the means of production and distribution are privately owned but are also subject to government regulation to keep markets free, prevent abuses, and ensure public safety. A safety net is provided to redistribute wealth to those unable to provide for themselves, such as the poor, the handicapped, and the elderly. In Animal Farm, George Orwell, a British writer who considered himself a democratic socialist, uses allegory to express his deep disdain for the corruption of the leaders of the Soviet Union, most notably Joseph Stalin, and promulgates the belief that it is this corruption that destroys revolutions rather than what may be the fundamentals of the revolution itself. Animal Farm was published in 1945 and addresses the period prior to World War II in the Soviet Union. It mirrors specific events in the years when Stalin, considered my most historians to be a brutal and ruthless leader, allied himself with western democracies yet betrayed the principles these countries represented as well as the principles of the revolution that established the communist system in the Soviet Union. Because it is such an excellent example of the use of allegory in fiction, Orwell's criticism of Stalinism has become required reading worldwide. Question 3: What would it take for a communist country to keep its social and economic system and yet be democratic? An allegory is an artistic device in which the characters and events of the story represent something more than what is directly stated. The literal content of an allegorical work is inevitably less important than its symbolic meaning. Allegory is employed in literature, visual arts, drama, and ballet. Allegory uses an extended metaphor, a comparison made between two dissimilar things that have some attribute in common, in which objects, characters, and even events in the story refer to objects, characters and events in real life. Animal Farm, technically a novella, is one of the premier works of modern fiction that uses allegory. Question 4: Write a brief summary of an allegory that you recall hearing or reading in which you can easily see the definition of the concept of allegory at work. You may want to consider fables, such as ""The Little Boy Who Cried Wolf"", to answer this question, although you can use novels or films that are allegories. [End of Worksheet] At the end of the unit, consider telling students some jokes developed by people in the Soviet Union to help them deal with the adversity of living in that society. Two of the best are set out below: What is the difference between capitalism and Soviet Communism? Answer: Capitalism is based on the exploitation of man by man. Under Soviet communism, it is the opposite. A new prisoner arrives at a prison camp and is asked by another prisoner about the length of his sentence. ""Seven years,"" he replies, ""but there was no crime. I didn't do anything."" The other prisoner responds, ""You must be lying, the sentence for nothing is only five years.""

Age: 8 - 13; MPAA Rating -- G; Comedy; 1956; 178 minutes; Color; Available from Amazon.com. Description:     The year is 1872. A well-to-do English gentleman, Phileas Fogg, bets members of his club that he can circumnavigate the world in 80 days. The bet is so large that unless he wins, his entire fortune will be lost. The film, based on a Jules Verne novel, is the suspense filled story of Fogg's attempt to win the bet. Benefits of the Movie: The plot turns on the International Date Line and the effects of the rotation of the Earth on time and travel. This is the best film that we have found to teach this subject. Viewers are also shown several different cultures and their attitudes towards the same events are contrasted with ours and with each other. Possible Problems:    MODERATE. The problems with this film would disqualify it if it were not a lighthearted comedy in which nothing is intended to be taken seriously. A good summary of the problems with this film is set out below: The wealthy English establishment is very conservative and against progress and new ideas. There is considerable betting on Fogg's journey. Fogg believes in progress, science, and intellectual deduction. Passepartout refers to him as ""master."" An Arab sadistically insists Passepartout fight a bull even if he doesn't know how. Fogg bribes people to make his journey faster. Passepartout breaks Brahman religious beliefs and is chased by a mob. One of the reasons they rescue Auda is that she was educated in England. They judge local religious customs by English standards. Fogg is arrested for desecrating a religious ritual; he immediately posts bail and skips town. Fogg speaks Pidgin English to a Chinese who, he finds out, speaks perfect English.

Now, about seventeen years later, Mike is out of shape, unemployed, and alienated from his high-school-aged-son and daughter. In addition, his wife has filed for divorce. One day, as Mike bitterly regrets his decision to forgo the basketball scholarship and his education, an angel appears and offers him the opportunity to do it all over, to be ""17 Again."" Back in his 17-year-old body and with a new identity, Mike re-enrolls in his old school, now attended by his children. However, Mike soon realizes that the second chance he has been given is to be the father that he never was and to help his kids out of their various difficulties.

Write the main points on the board, steering the definition toward the components recognized by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HRSA: aggressive behavior physical (hitting, punching) verbal (teasing and name calling; this is the most frequent type of bullying) social (usually exclusion) involves an imbalance of power or strength is usually repeated or maintained over a period of time girls bully as well as boys but usually use social exclusion bullying sets up a climate of fear and disrespect in a school Source: Stop Bullying Now. 3.  Write the following words on the board: ""Bully, Victim, Bystander = accomplice"" Usually teachers need to say no more.

Stop the film when the scene cuts from the cafeteria to Mike back at home, digging through the refrigerator. Mike's psychological analysis of Stan, the school bully, is reproduced below: Mike: You know, Stan, I feel sorry for you. Stan: You don't know me. Mike: Oh, but I do, all too well. You're the man. Captain of the basketball team, dates the pretty girls, high school is your kingdom. But people, Stan is a bully. Why? It'd be way too easy to say Stan preys on the weak simply because he's a dick. No . . . no . . . no. . . . Stan here is much more complex than that. See, according to leading psychiatrists Stan is a bully for one of three reasons. . . . One . . . underneath all that male bravado there's an insecure little girl just banging on the closet door trying to get out. Two . . . like a caveman, Stan's brain is . . . underdeveloped, therefore Stan is unable to use self-control and so he acts out aggressively. And the third reason? Stan has a small wiener. . . . . 5.   Analyze with the class whether Mike's analysis of Stan is correct. Here are some points to bring out in the discussion. DO BULLIES PUT DOWN OTHERS TO COVER FOR THEIR OWN INSECURITIES? In his first insult Mike compares Stan to someone who is insecure, to a weak girl and to a gay boy who doesn't quite have the courage to come out of the closet. Mike's comments are sexist and homophobic. They are also inaccurate. Obviously, being female or being gay have nothing to do with being a bully. Nor does insecurity have much to do with being a bully. Psychological studies find that most bullies ""see themselves quite positively"" and are unaware of what their fellow students actually think of them. What makes most bullies starts in early childhood. They have ingrained patterns of using aggression and hostility in their relationships with others. To solve conflicts and get along in life, bullies rely on aggression and the fear and power that their aggression creates. They have difficulty relating to people on other levels. Marano, H.E., Big Bad Bully Psychology Today. A feeling of insecurity is only one of many things that can trigger a hostile or violent response from a bully. In fact, no trigger is necessary for a bully to be hostile or aggressive. The idea that bullying behavior arises from feelings of insecurity comes from the efforts of normal people to understand what makes a bully. When most people think about this question they use the context of their own, more normal personalities. For them, covering feelings of insecurity by lashing out at others is a natural, if dysfunctional, response. However, bullies don't see the world that way. For them, aggression, violence, and hostility in human relations are the norm. DO BULLIES HAVE AN UNDERDEVELOPED BRAIN? While bullies don't have underdeveloped brains per se, they do have cognitive differences from other people. They ""perceive provocation where it does not exist . . . [they] act aggressively because they process social information inaccurately."" Ibid. An example is when someone accidentally bumps into a bully and the bully sees it as an aggressive action, triggering a violent or abusive response. It's not that bullies lack the ability to control their aggressive impulses; they don't see the need to control them. However, the truth of Mike's comment lies in the fact that the aggressive behavior patterns of bullies often hinder the development of intellectual skills, specifically verbal intelligence. By the sixth grade, half of all students identified by their classmates as bullies have been kept back a grade or are taking remedial classes. But it doesn't stop there. Id. Compared to kids who are not physically aggressive, students who use violence, aggression, and hostility in their interactions with others are setting themselves up for a downward spiral into a life of alcoholism, depression, crime, spousal abuse, and child abuse. Studies show that more than half of boys who were named as bullies in middle school have at least one criminal conviction by the age of 24. Id. DO BULLIES HAVE SMALL PENISES? This is another joke. There is no scientific study that inversely links penis size to bullying. Howevever, one long-term study showed that at age 13, boys who had been identified as the most physically aggressive in elementary school had lower testosterone than their fellow students. Scientists are not exactly sure how this finding relates to bullying.Id. 6.   Show the clip again and ask the class to look for any classic bullying techniques that Mike employs to humiliate Stan.

Subject:     Science/Physics — Inertia Ages:   12+; Middle School to High School Length:      Film Clips: 3 Clips of approximately 9 minutes. Learner Outcomes/Objectives:    Students will have a visual impression of inertia, the centrifugal force and artificial gravity in space travel. Rationale:     Few movies staged in space have attempted or achieved such a degree of accuracy in their showing of weightlessness and artificial gravity created using the centrifugal force as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Description of the Snippet:     The scenes show the exterior and interior of a rotating space station. Helpful Background:     There are four fundamental forces in nature: gravity, electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces. However, in every day life it appears that we experience other forces that are none of the above, such as inertial forces. These are part of Newton's three laws of motion. Newton's first law describes inertia and states that ""Every object in a state of uniform motion or at rest tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it."" Thus, when we try to accelerate an object, it will resist, trying to keep its previous state, which is either sitting still, or moving at a certain constant velocity (speed and direction). Any change in the motion of an object requires a force and is called acceleration. (Newton´s second and most universal law of motion: ""The acceleration of a body is directly proportional to, and in the same direction as, the net force acting on the body, and inversely proportional to its mass. Thus, F = ma, where F is the net force acting on the object, m is the mass of the object and a is the acceleration of the object."") From the point of view of the object being accelerated (or anything sitting on it), the resistance to change is felt as a force in the opposite direction to the force that is being applied to accelerate it. Thus, in a car starting to go forward after having stopped at a traffic light the passengers will feel being pushed into the seats, i.e. a force pushing them in the opposite direction to the forward acceleration applied by stepping on the gas. When something is made to move more slowly there is also acceleration, but it is a negative one. So, if the brakes are applied in a vehicle, the force is acting in the direction opposite of the motion of the car, i.e. backwards. The resistance to this force will then push the passengers forward. We have all experienced this in a car that is slowing down and it is the reason why we wear seat belts ? if the deceleration is sudden and extreme, as in an accident, the forward push could actually make someone not wearing a seat belt fly through the glass windshield. The two examples mentioned so far are about changes to speed, but there is another change that can be made to the motion of an object: it can be made to change direction. This kind of acceleration, which causes the moving objects to describe a curve, is called centripetal, from the Latin words centrum (center) and petere (move towards), as it seems to push the object to the imaginary center of a curve. Again, there is a resistance against the centripetal force in the opposite direction, i.e. towards the outside of that curve, called centrifugal force (fugere: to escape from). Sitting in a car we have all also experienced this, feeling being pushed towards the outside of the curve. Now, there is yet another level this can be taken to. If an object is sitting on a rotating disk and is moved either towards or away from its center, its forward speed is actually changed: closer to the center it will be smaller; further away from the center, the speed will be higher. So, effectively, a change in motion has happened, and this change will have its corresponding resistance. This one bears the name of the physicist who was able to identify it as such: Coriolis. It may seem a lesser known force, but it can be easily experienced by anyone trying to walk across a carousel: they will be pushed sideways. It has also large scale consequences on our planet: imaginarily observed from above the north or south poles, cloud masses can be clearly seen moving either towards or away from the center of the rotation of the Earth (the axis of the rotation). The clouds are then pushed sideways and form the huge cyclones and anticyclones of the weather of Earth. For a clip which will show students how the Coriolis effect works, see The Coriolis Effect from PBS Nova. All these forces that are felt in reaction to a change in the motion of an object are called inertial forces. They are also known as fictitious forces, because no one is actually exerting them: the real forces are those the inertial forces appear to be reacting against. The inertial forces themselves can only be felt by or on the accelerated objects, and only represent resistance to change. However, for those being pushed around by them, they do feel very real! On the rotating ""centrifuge"" in 2001: A Space Odyssey, the centrifugal force is used to mimic the gravity on Earth. We see one of the movie characters running along the outer wall of this room, showing that artificial gravity has indeed been achieved, allowing him to jog as if on Earth. But in order to replace the gravity of the Earth, it has to achieve the right strength, and it so happens that the strength of centrifugal force depends on the velocity at which the object is rotating (stronger for faster rotation) and, for a given rotational velocity, the distance from the center, as further out a fixed rotational velocity implies moving at faster speeds, and faster speeds will yield stronger outward (centrifugal) forces, as we all know from when a curve is taken too fast. Even this is taken into account accurately in the film, when one member of the crew accesses the centrifuge through the hub at the center and is seen to be weightless until he actually gains distance from the center by climbing ""down"" the ladder. So, for the runner to feel a centrifugal force that is equal to the gravity of the Earth, the rotating room needs to be rotating at a certain speed. And then the centrifugal force will only be felt to be equal to the gravity of the Earth at a certain distance from the center, which in the case of the spaceship in 2001: A Space Odyssey, is the outer wall of the room. Only that part of the spaceship would therefore feel ""Earth-like"" in terms of gravity. In the giant wheel shaped Space Station V, the rotation is also mimicking gravity in all rooms located on the outer rim, as the lights (and other sequences in the film) show that it is there where life on the station actually takes place; but this will not be the case in the corridors along the radii or in areas nearer the centre. Is this a solution that will be applied in the future in order to mimic Earth-like conditions in space? There are various arguments that lead one to think that this will actually not be the case, such as the very large size that would be required of a space station for the centrifugal force to approach the force of gravity on earth and the fact that many research projects send equipment and people into space in order to experiment with weightlessness. Thus, artificial gravity would have no purpose.",2001: A Space Odyssey,30,B004L9GMBC

Animations from the Internet show how the motion of the planets (the ""wanderers"" in ancient Greek) are explained in both the geocentric and heliocentric models of the Solar system. Description of the Film Clips and the Animations:     In clip # 1 Hypatia is shown teaching in fifth century Alexandria. She gives the ancient explanation for the tendency of objects to fall to earth, i.e., the assumption that the Earth is at the center of the Universe, to which all objects are attracted. Clip #1 from Agora: From 0:00:48 to 0:04:26. This clip starts at the beginning of the film, just after opening credits, when the night sky is shown from outer space and the legend explaining the setting of the film comes onto the screen. It ends after the scene of the prayer to Sarapis. Explain to the class that Hypatia is teaching within the Library of Alexandria which was also a center for worship of the Pagan gods. Clip #2 from Agora: From 0:12:00 to 0:15:34. This clip begins just after Hypatia has put salve on Davus' back where he was whipped by her father. She sees his model of the Ptolemaic system. Orests then criticizes the Ptolemaic system because it is not straightforward, instinctively applying Occam's Razor. He is criticized by a Christian who for not accepting the universe as God made it. The clip ends when Hypatia states that despite all that is going on in the streets, the scholars in the class are all brothers and asks for a round of applause for Davus' model. Animation # 1 shows the Ptolemaic system. This short animation made need to be allowed to run server al times. Animation #2 explains the apparent retrograde motion of Mars in the heavens. Show this short animation several times, pointing out the difference in the speeds at which the Earth and Mars orbit the Sun. Point out the site lines that show when the animation is not moving. An alternative suitable for 11th and 12th Grade Honors classes or for college level students is to also use a clip in which Hypatia discovers that the Earth moves around the Sun in an eliptical orbit. This clip lasts for about 4.5 minutes from 1:41:18 to 1:45:42. There is no evidence in the historical record that this discovery was made until some 1200 years after Hypatia died when Copernicus, inspired by Aristarcus, demonstrated that the Sun was the center of the solar system and Kepler discovered that the Earth's orbit around the Sun was eliptical in shape. Second, the scene does not accurately show the process by which such a discovery would have been made because it would have been based on precise astronomical measurements and testing and rejecting various hypotheses to arrive at a hypothesis which seemed to match observations. TWM recommends showing this scene only if, through class assignments or lectures, the class looks carefully at empricism in Ancient Greco-Roman science. See Suggestions for Using the Third Film Clip. Helpful Background:     The geocentric model, not only of the Solar System, but of the Universe held sway from the time of the ancient Greeks hundreds of years before Christ and was only challenged in the 16th century C.E. after which it was gradually replaced by the heliocentric view of the Solar System and a view of the Universe that has no particular center. The main proponents of the geocentric system were Aristotle and Ptolemy. Geocentrism was endorsed by the early Christians and the Catholic church because it appeared to be consistent with certain Biblical passages. (Joshua 10:12 in which the Sun and Moon are said to stop in the sky, and Psalms 93:1 in which the world is described as immobile.) Even today, some adherents of Biblical fundamentalism claim that the Earth is the center of the Universe and that the Sun revolves around the Earth. The Ptolemaic geocentric system posited that the circle was a perfect shape and that all movements in the heavens were circular. See detailed animation of the Ptolemaic system from the Nebraska Astronomy Applet Project. The latter was first challenged by the apparent movement of the planets in the sky with respect to the stars, particularly that of Mars, in its recurrent retrograde motion. It appears to move backwards and form a loop for a brief time before resuming its regular path across the star field. Hypatia's fictional slave Davus makes a model that illustrates the solution proposed by Ptolemy to explain the retrograde motion of the planets preserving the circle as the only possible orbit (clip #2). Ptolemy's explanation involves the superposition of two circular motions which, together, are able to explain the retrograde motion of Mars together with the other observed paths of the planets across the sky while keeping the Earth at its center. But adding circle upon circle only made the models more complicated and it is an accepted principle among scientists to think that nature tends toward the simple. This idea is behind Occam's Razor, a principle of logic by which the simpler option is preferred between competing theories, all else being equal. So, the Ptolemaic model with its epicycles seemed a strained explaination of the observed motion of the planets. To move away from it, however, it would take two more gigantic leaps in understanding that would have to wait more than a thousand years after the time of Hypatia. The first new concept was that the Earth is not the center of the Universe and the second was to let go of the notion that the circle was the only possible orbit in the Universe. Polish astronomer Nikolas Copernicus hypothesized in 1543 that the Sun, and not the Earth, was at the center of the Solar System. Debate followed for many years. Shortly afterwards the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe tried to come up with a compromise between both models, placing the Earth in the center of the universe and placing the Moon and the Sun in (circular) orbits around it. All the planets also had circular orbit around the Sun. The spell of circularity was difficult to shake off. The finding that orbits of the planets were not circular, but were instead elliptical was made by Johannes Kepler.

Students at any level who see this section of the movie may ask to see the rest of the film, which contains several important lessons about the power of an individual to resist injustice and to right a wrong through the legal system. The entire movie is 103 minutes in length. After refusing to agree to a plea bargain, the film's heroine is bailed out of jail by her mother. She is then approached by the American Civil Liberties Union which has evidence that the local District Attorney has conducted a series of racially motivated mass arrests without probable cause. Ms. Roberts agrees to become the plaintiff in a lawsuit brought to stop the abuse and endures difficulties and tests before the case succeeds. Possible problems with showing the entire film are minor — there are some threatening domestic altercations between Ms. Roberts and her former husband which may be disturbing to some children.

Guide the class discussion to at least the following points, supplying the information if the class cannot respond to the questions: a definition of plea bargaining - In a plea bargain the defendant gets a reduced sentence or the dismissal of some of the charges; in return, the defendant must plead guilty or ""no contest"" to one or more crimes; when a person accused of a crime enters into a plea bargain, he or she waives certain constitutional rights; almost all criminal cases (95%, according to the U.S. Supreme Court) end in a plea bargain, not a trial; it is up to prosecutors to decide whether to charge someone with a crime or what particular crime to charge them with. Tell the class that after the film clip, there will be a discussion about the benefits and costs of the plea bargaining system to persons accused of crimes, to prosecutors, and to society. 2.    Show the first 31 minutes of the film, ending when Dee Roberts' friend takes a plea, although she was innocent, and is allowed to go home. Dee then sinks to the floor of the cell with her head in her hands. 3.    After the clip has been shown, ask students what constitutional rights the accused person gives up when he or she takes a plea bargain. Here are a few rights that should be included in any discussion; again if the class cannot supply the answers, the teacher can provide the information: trial by jury; the right to a unanimous verdict; the right to require the government to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; the right to remain silent - a plea bargain usually provides that a defendant plead guilty to some crime; the right to confront their accuser in court.",American Violet,32,B002FUIJ24

Description of the Snippet:     The first 9.5 minutes of the documentary introduces Leo Theremin and his invention, with some explanations about the principles by which this electronic instrument works. Helpful Background:     The fascination of the Theremin lies in its apparently magical ability to transform hand movements into sounds without any physical contact. This first electronic instrument makes use of two antennae which emit and receive invisible signals and transform them into sound. However, the person playing the Theremin is not emitting signals that the antennae could receive, but seemingly plays the instrument without affecting it in any way. In order to understand the solution to this mystery let us first address how antennae work with common audio and video signals. Antennae are made of metal, because metals are good conductors of electricity. The electrons in the antennae can easily move about and a controlled motion —an oscillating motion— is induced in the antennae by the electromagnetic waves which arrive from an emitter far away. (In the same way a cork floating in water and out of reach will be caused to move up and down by waves that transport the oscillation to it.) The emitter controls this motion by modulating the frequency (FM = frequency modulation) or amplitude (AM = amplitude modulation) of the waves, thus encoding the desired information that the antennae can then relay to the decoders in our radio or TV sets. So, the radio and TV signals are waves made of oscillating electromagnetic fields (just as waves in water are made of oscillating water particles). We also know that the radio and TV signals are not the only electromagnetic fields present around us in the air. There are other communication signals, like those of mobile phone communication. Magnetic fields are generated by electric currents as well as magnets (that's why there are interferences in car radios when driving past or along a power line). Electric fields are generated by electric charges and changing magnetic fields. (The symmetry between these two sentences is the basis of the theory of electromagnetism as most elegantly formulated by James C. Maxwell, but that is beyond the scope of this lesson plan.) All objects have a certain capacity to store electrical charges, called capacitance. This is extensively used in electronic circuits in whichcapacitors are used to temporarily store electrical charge, especially when a certain minimal amount of it is needed to produce a desired effect. Capacitors have two identical elements (usually plates) separated from each other so that electric charge can be accumulated on one of them before it is suddenly released to the other, e.g. by reaching a threshold above which a spark will transport all the charge from one to the other. Capacitors are used in neon lights. In order to be switched on these lights need a high amount of charge to be released. This is why there is always a capacitor attached to every one of them. When power is given to such lights by pressing the switch, the capacitor quickly accumulates the charge and then releases the necessary amount for the neon to begin shining. In a way, it can be said that the capacitor has ""condensed"" the otherwise flowing charge into a ""lump."" This is why capacitors were formerly known as ""condensers,"" a word that is still used in most languages for these elements of electric circuits. Capacitance (C) is commonly introduced as a measure of the amount of charge (Q) stored on each plate of the capacitor for a given potential difference or voltage (V) C= Q/V. However, its real meaning is better understood if the formula is rearranged to Q=CV and explained as the proportionality factor that determines how much charge can be accumulated if induced by a given voltage: a higher capacitance will allow the storage of a higher amount of charge. The Theremin works because the human body has a capacitance, which means that it naturally stores a certain amount of electric charge with respect to its environment or nearby objects. On dry days, walking with rubber soled shoes on synthetic material can very quickly charge our body to the point that it has to release a small but annoying charge, especially when it comes unexpectedly. Without reaching these extreme conditions, people store a small amount of charge at all times. This charge inevitably generates an electric field, and this electric field can affect the electrons in a metal rod, as for example an antenna. (This can often be experienced when one manually tries to orient the antenna for better reception and this annoyingly changes when you move away from it!) When the electrons of an antenna are oscillating, the proximity of a human being, or even small parts of a person such as the hands, can produce alterations in the oscillation patterns in the antenna. In the case of antennae acting as receivers of radio or TV signals this can be a nuisance, but in a Theremin it can be used to generate music! The oscillation of the electrons of the two antennae in a Theremin are induced by an oscillator inside the apparatus, and these oscillations are continuously transformed into sound by a carefully adjusted electronic sound generator (just as in the case of the radio receiver). When the hand of the player approaches the antennae, the electrical field produced by the electrical charges stored in the body changes the oscillation from the oscillators. This is picked up by the antennas and, due to the circuitry in the Theremin, this change changes the pitch and the volume of the sound that is being generated. The first of the lessons by Thereminist Thomas Grillo (7 minutes 31 seconds) shows how the interaction between the movements of the hand and the antennae control the sounds made by a Theremin. It also shows the extreme sensitivity a Theremin has with respect to small position changes of the hands. Watching these lessons is very enticing and one may feel the urge to try for oneself. In fact, the Theremin is quite difficult to play. One of the reasons is that there are no set keys or frets for specific notes, but instead it offers a continuous range of potential sounds of varying pitch. It is like the human voice or the trombone: the singer/player has to be very sure that each note is correct and a very good musical ear is needed. There is no instrument tuner as with a piano who comes to tune a Theremin! The Theremin has been used several times in popular music. The Theremin was used by Brian Jones of The Rolling Stones in the 1967 albums ""Between the Buttons"" and ""Their Satanic Majesties Request."" A variation of the Theremin (without the loop) was used by Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin during performances of ""Whole Lotta Love"" and ""No Quarter"". Movies in which the Theremin is used in the soundtrack include: Spellbound, The Red House, The Lost Weekend The Spiral Staircase, Rocketship X-M, The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Thing (From Another World), The Ten Commandments (the 1956 DeMille film), The Delicate Delinquent, Monster House, Ed Wood The Machinist and Hellboy. Historical Note Leon Theremin was born in Russia in 1896. He was a scientist, inventor, and musician. He invented the Theremin in 1920 after noticing that the human body would change the waves produced by an oscillator. He played the instrument for Vladimir Lenin, the first ruler of the Soviet Union and was sent on an international tour to show the world the sophistication of Soviet science. Theremin moved to the U.S. several years later, living in New York City as a celebrity inventor. There was quite a bit of interest in his instrument and it was used in concerts with some symphony orchestras. Suddenly, in 1938 Theremin disappeared. Some said that he fled debt collectors. Others claimed that he was dead. Still others asserted that he had been kidnapped by the Soviet secret police, the KGB. Whatever happened, he returned (or was brought back) to Russia and was sent to a special Gulag in Siberia for ""re-education"" along with many other Russian intellectuals who had left the Soviet Union or who were considered unreliable by Stalin, the Soviet dictator. In the camp Theremin was recruited to work for the KGB. He invented a miniature listening device used by Russian spies during World War II. This was considered so important by Soviet authorities that Theremin received the Lenin Prize and was rehabilitated. By the 1990s Theremin was back in New York where he lived out his life and was discovered by a documentary film-maker who made the movie that will be seen in this lesson.",Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey,33,

Learner Outcomes/Objectives:     Students will learn about the properties that make antimatter different from matter at fundamental level and the energy released in different kinds of explosions. Rationale:     The film clips provide an excellent supplement to vary the classroom experience for a unit on fundamental particles of physics. Description of the Snippet:    A flask containing recently produced antimatter is stolen from the research facility at CERN and used to threaten Vatican City with mass destruction. The explosion actually takes place but high up in the sky with only minor destruction at ground level. Helpful Background:     So, what is antimatter? Most explanations given in books and documentaries do not answer this question. Instead, they tell us how antimatter behaves, what it does when it comes in contact with ""ordinary"" matter. It is repeatedly said that antimatter is in a form that is opposite to ordinary matter. But in which sense is it ""opposite""? The usual answer is in terms of electric charge: the ""opposite"" of en electron would be a particle with an identical mass but positive electric charge. This anti-electron is also known as a positron. However, if it all comes down to electric charge one might ask what all the hype is about. We are familiar with objects of opposite electric charge and how they attract each other without an apocalyptic explosion. There must be something deeper about antimatter than just opposite electric charges. Paul Dirac first predicted the existence of antimatter in the specific case of the anti-electron, which has an electrical charge opposite to that of the electron. However, the fundamental difference between the two is of a deeper nature and the different electrical charge is just one manifestation of that fundamental difference. In the case of a neutron and an antineutron, for example, their electrical charge obviously does not play any role, as they both are electrically neutral. In order to take the explanation of the constituents of matter one level deeper, scientists talk in terms of quarks. Quarks and electrons are members of a family of fundamental particles known as leptons. The famous Higgs boson is also lepton. They are the most fundamental level of matter according to the Standard Model. ***Quarks are ascribed various fundamental properties which are called charges, the electrical charge being just one of them. Other quark charges are known as isospin, color and flavor (the names of the latter two not being at all related to their usual meanings). In antiquarks both electrical and other charges are of opposite sign, while other properties such as mass, mean lifetime and spin remain unchanged. It happens similarly with leptons and their own different set of fundamental properties. Let us therefore bear in mind that matter and antimatter are ""opposite"" in a more fundamental way than just electrical charge, even though this is commonly used as the easiest way to explain it. Of course, transposing the question of what antimatter is to the next deepest level may still not seem to provide a satisfactory answer: why would an encounter between quarks and antiquarks with their opposite charges be so different from letting two electrically charged particles of opposite signs attract each other up to their closest possible approach? Why do scientists and sci-fi authors alike talk about destructive annihilation? In order to understand this a little better, let us review how Paul Dirac imagined it. Paul Dirac was the scientist whose theoretical work first hinted at the existence of antimatter. Even if his imagined model for antimatter is now superseded, it helps us to appreciate the fundamental difference between attraction between opposite charges and matter-antimatter annihilation. To proceed we need to introduce the concept of ""negative"" energy. The ""ordinary"" energy we are familiar with in our everyday lives is always positive. In Physics, energy is understood as the ""capacity of producing a physical change on an object"". So, the passage of electrons through a thin wire heats it up and can even make it give out light, as we can see in incandescent bulbs (the term ""negative"" for the electrical charge of electrons being just a label with no more fundamental meaning). Or gravitational attraction is able to pull a ball down a slope and speed it up. In both cases the energy used to produce changes in temperature and speed, respectively, is a positive number. It is like cash: you may have more or less, or none at all, but the amount you can handle is always positive. However, as in the case of money, you could imagine handling debt. If this debt is put on paper, you could imagine the corresponding pieces of paper as ""negative"" money. So, in order to explain some results from his theoretical calculations, on the specific case of the electron, Dirac postulated that there is an endless ""sea"" of electrons that goes unnoticed because in its usual state, that sea is completely full and occupies the whole of space. On occasions some very energetic physical process is able to extract one electron from that sea, and we are left with an empty ""hole"" in its place. A hole in a sea of negative electrical charges behaves as a positive charge, and this is what we would detect as an anti-electron or positron. If an electron encounters the positron it will ""fill in ""the hole, disappearing in the undetected electron sea and releasing the vast amount of energy that went into extracting the electron that left the hole. There we have a fundamental difference between different electrical charges attracting each other (such as a proton and an electron) and the annihilation of antimatter and matter when brought together (such as a positron and an electron, but also a neutron and an antineutron, etc.). Particle physicists are making fast progress in the creation, trapping and storage of antimatter, in particular of antiprotons, or anti-Hydrogen nuclei (as a Hydrogen nucleus actually is a single proton). Vast amounts of energies, which can only be generated in huge particle accelerators like those at Fermilab (http://www.fnal.gov/) or CERN (http://public.web.cern.ch/public/) are needed to create tiny amounts of anti-hydrogen. But trapping and storing it poses an even bigger challenge, as it needs to be kept away from any ordinary matter in order to avoid annihilation. The fiction of Angels and Demons anticipated the progress that is being made in reality in this regard. It depicts the successful creation of a chunk of antimatter and its storage in a special flask that keeps it away from the walls of the container, and is powered by a battery that needs to be reloaded or replaced. The amount of anti-hydrogen produced, and therefore the magnitude of the explosion that can occur if annihilation takes place, is fictional.",Antimatter,34,B002O5M4TE

This ","MINOR. There is a brief, tender, and tasteful scene of lovemaking. There is no gore and no gratuitous violence. Parenting Points:     This entry is extensive, but the benefits of introducing children to honor cultures are substantial. Before watching ""Behind the Sun,"" tell your children that the people in the movie are living in an ""honor culture"" in which feelings of personal worth and social status depend upon how closely they adhere to a code which requires that they exact revenge on people seen as having dishonored them or their family. Honor cultures can be found all over the world. For the most part, Western societies have moved beyond honor culture values that survive only in some subcultures, such as gangs, and in a few countries of Southeast Europe and some parts of Latin America. After watching the film, tell your children the following: In modern society the impulse for revenge is replaced by going to court and seeking justice. For example: ""If someone hurts a member of our family, we call the police and ask the government to take them to court, rather than trying to settle the score with violence."" In modern Western cultures, people act according to standards of right conduct set out in ethical rules like the Golden Rule, the Ten Commandments, or the Six Pillars of Character. Forgiveness is a strongly held value. These values are internalized (hopefully) in our consciences. People who do not act ethically are not held in high esteem. Honor cultures, on the other hand, are not governed by ideas of what is right or wrong. A man's sense of self-worth and his status in society come from how strongly he defends his honor and the honor of his family. In honor cultures, prestige lies in how closely a man adheres to a code, which can be written or handed down verbally from generation to generation, that regulates how to take revenge on people seen as dishonoring the man or his family. If your children are interested in these issues, you can ask and help them to answer Discussion Questions #s 9 - 14 and Question #1 under the Social-Emotional Learning topic ""Revenge.""

Note to Teachers: 21st century American teenagers watch this film with rapt attention. Its two protagonists are young, and students identify with their struggles. The movie is in Portuguese with English subtitles. Because of the film's compelling story and its ability to pull teenagers into its world, students don't have a problem with the subtitles. Before using this movie, look for recent newspaper articles relating to blood feuds to show to the class. They appear periodically. See, for example, LA Times August 5, 2012 article about a modern-day blood feud in Brazil's sertão with a striking resemblance to the story told in this movie. Description:     The year is 1910; the place is the sertão, the semi-arid inland area of Northeastern Brazil. 20-year-old Tonio is the middle son of an impoverished farm family, the Breves. He is next in line to kill and then be killed in an ongoing blood feud with a neighboring clan, the Ferreiras. For generations, the two families have quarreled over land. Now they are locked in a series of tit-for-tat assassinations of their sons: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth — a life for a life. Embedded in this choreography of death is a particular code of ethics: ""Blood has the same volume for everyone. You have no right to take more blood than was taken from you."" The world of this movie is suffused with a sense of futility and stoic despair. Under pressure from his father, Tonio kills a Ferreira son to avenge the murder of Tonio's older brother. This act marks him as the next victim. Tonio's younger brother is addressed only as ""the Kid"" by the family. Anticipating future loss, his parents haven't given him a name. The Kid is an imaginative and loving child, whose spirit will not break in the face of harsh parenting, brutalizing isolation, and numbing poverty. The Kid's love encourages Tonio to question his fate. When Tonio meets Clara, a charming itinerant circus girl, he gets a glimpse of life's possibilities. Will he be able to escape the cycle of human sacrifice on the alter of revenge? Can the cycle be broken? The inspiration for the movie was the novel Broken April, by Ismail Kadare, which describes a blood feud in the mountains of Albania. The message is universal. Benefits of the Movie:     This film is useful in teaching: (1) some of the reasons why revenge has been rejected by modern developed societies and the rule of law adopted instead; (2) the international scope and moral bankruptcy of honor cultures; and (3) the literary devices of symbolism, motif, subplot, foreshadowing, and flashback. This Learning Guide supports lessons on all three teaching strengths of the film. Honor cultures are prevalent in the Middle East and Central Asia. Vestiges of honor cultures continue to exist in the Balkans and in some parts of Latin America. Future voters who will make decisions about policy in those areas will benefit from an introduction to honor cultures. In addition, there are vestiges of honor culture in U.S. society particularly in the South and West, among teenagers, and in gang culture. For all of these reasons, the study of honor culture is important for secondary school students. Possible Problems:    MINOR. There is a brief, tender, and tasteful scene of lovemaking.

Forgiveness is a strongly held value. These values are internalized (hopefully) in our consciences. People who do not act ethically are not held in high esteem. Honor cultures, on the other hand, are not governed by ideas of what is right or wrong. A man's sense of self-worth and his status in society come from how strongly he defends his honor and the honor of his family. In honor cultures, prestige lies in how closely a man adheres to a code, which can be written or handed down verbally from generation to generation, that regulates how to take revenge on people seen as dishonoring the man or his family. If your children are interested in these issues, you can ask and help them to answer Discussion Questions #s 9 - 14 and Question #1 under the Social-Emotional Learning topic ""Revenge."" Then ask and take your children through the answer to the Quick Discussion Question. Tell them that the institution in our society that substitutes for revenge is the court system. Finally, repeat the difference between modern Western societies and honor cultures.",Behind the Sun,43,B0000640VQ

Description:    In this charming Disney classic, a mouse named Amos claims credit for many of Benjamin Franklin's accomplishments and inventions.   Benefits of the Movie:This film will introduce children to Benjamin Franklin: scientist, inventor, educator, patriot, diplomat, printer, author, philosopher, musician, public servant and economist. Franklin (1706-1790) was a Founding Father of the United States and one of the most remarkable men produced by Western civilization. It will also demonstrate the fun and importance of inventions and experiments. Before Watching the Movie: Tell your child as much about Ben Franklin as you can. Not only was he a great scientist who made important discoveries about electricity, he was also a great patriot. He helped pass the Declaration of Independence. Later, he served as ambassador to France. The French King sent his Navy to help with the War of Independence. It stopped the British from escaping by sea at Yorktown and assisted in the victory that won the war. Franklin was also an author, a newspaper publisher, and an inventor. We still use some of his inventions. Ben Franklin thought up the idea of public libraries that lend books to people.   LEARNING GUIDE MENU Benefits of the Movie Possible Problems Before Watching the Movie Playing for Growth Talking for Growth Story Time Building Vocabulary Discussion Questions --- Social-Emotional Learning --- Moral-Ethical Emphasis       (Character Counts) Bridges to Reading Links to the Internet Selected Awards & Cast For older children who are interested, see a more complete explanation of Franklin's achievements at Supplementary Materials on Ben Franklin. Possible Problems:     None.   Playing for Growth: 1.  You and your child can experience the fun and excitement of inventing. Collect a couple of household items (like empty 2-liter bottles, toilet paper rolls, paper towel rolls, paper plates and bowls, aluminum foil, shoe boxes, rubber bands, etc.), as well as some tape, glue or pipe cleaners, and set everything out. Work with your child to invent something new from these everyday objects. (For example: if you wrap rubber bands across a shoebox without the lid, you've made a guitar!) 2.  You can also perform safe and entertaining experiments from home. Place two teaspoons of baking soda into an clean empty soda pop bottle and add an inch of water. Next, take a balloon and place a tablespoon of white vinegar into the balloon. Cover the mouth of the bottle tightly with the mouth of the balloon without releasing the vinegar into the bottle. Then release the vinegar and allow it to flow into the bottle. What happens to the balloon? (It should inflate with carbon dioxide gas formed in the chemical reaction.) See Baking Soda Experiment from the Sciences Explorer. A simpler version of the same experiment is to take the clean, empty soda bottle and pour a little bit of baking soda in the bottom. Go outside, or place the bottle into the bathtub or large plastic container (to contain the mess!). Slowly add white vinegar. Have children who can write take notes about how the experiment was set up, what was added, and what happened. Explain that making these ""observations"" are what real scientists and inventors do to try to understand what happened. 3.  Collect various items from around the house and from your backyard or a park (e.g., small rocks, twigs, leaves, empty soda can, paper crumpled into a ball, aluminum foil and aluminum foil crumpled into a ball). Fill up a sink, bathtub, or large plastic tub with water. Ask your child which items will sink and which will float. Make a list of each item you have collected and make a check to the right of the ones that your child thinks will sink. (This is the ""hypothesis."" A scientist when he designs an experiment states what he thinks will happen and then goes about finding a way to test it out.) Then, one by one, drop the objects in the water. As each object either floats or sinks put an X next to the name of the objects that sink. When you have dropped each object into the water see how your Xs and check marks line up. Was your child's hypothesis correct? If your child is interested, take the next step and try to decide why certain objects float and others sink. Form a new hypothesis about that. Let your child think one up and then figure out a way to test it. For example, you could test whether objects of one color float and objects of another color sink. When that hypotheses is disproven, try another. When you are ready to get to the one that works, try: if the object is heavier than the amount of water of the same size, it will sink. Otherwise it will float. Then test your new hypothesis with other objects to see if it works. Explain that we learn new things by experimenting, and by testing our ideas to see if they are right. 4.  Talk about things that Ben Franklin invented or studied. Show some examples in your house. Possibilities are: electricity, bifocals, a rocking chair, an almanac, and a Franklin stove. Count how many light bulbs you have in your house. Talk about other inventions that were important, like the telephone. Share with your child what your favorite invention is, and ask him or her to do the same. 5.  In the movie, we were able to see a little bit about the history of Amos' family. Make a family tree for them. Use one of the templates suggested at Kids Central Family Tree web page or make your own by drawing a simple tree with branches on a piece of paper. Then add your child's name at the very top. Work down, adding siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles. You can simply write their names or do a stick-figure drawing, or you can use real photographs. Talk about your family's history including where your family came from, name changes, etc.   If you engage in two or three of these activities, you'll be doing great! At about the middle of the movie, take a break and turn it off for a while. Start a conversation about the movie by asking a question about something that happened in the story. A good question for any movie is ""What do you think will happen next?"" You can also help your child recap the highlights of the first part before viewing the second. Are you concerned that time will be wasted if you are absent from class? Worry no more  .  .  .   Check out TeachWithMovies' Set-Up-the-Sub. Give us your feedback! Was the Guide helpful?

Talking for Growth The themes of this movie include: 1.  Inventions and experiments are fun and important. 2.  Helping other people is something anyone can do. 3.  Ben Franklin was an admirable person. 4.  Ben Franklin's Aphorisms. Inventions and experiments are fun and important. 1.  Name and talk about some of the things that Ben Franklin (and Amos) invented. Do we still use any of Ben's inventions? Which ones? Are there any in the house? Talking about it: Help your child recall the inventions shown in the film; bifocals, the Franklin stove, the rocking chair, the lightning rod, and the almanac. We still use many of Ben's inventions. Talk about how these inventions work and help us out. Bifocals: These are glasses which have two different corrections. The one on the bottom half of the lens is for looking at things that are close when we are reading or sewing. The top half of the lens is for looking at things far away. If they use bifocals, people won't need two pairs of glasses. The Franklin Stove: This is a metal stove set in the center of the room with a pipe going through the roof to take away the smoke and dangerous fumes from the fire. It puts out more heat than a fireplace because all sides of the fire are heating the air in the room. This is much better than a fireplace set against and outside wall. Heat from one side of the fire escapes outside. The Rocking Chair: Can you imagine life without rocking chairs? The Lightning Rod: Franklin was the first to discover that lightning was a form of electricity. In those days lightning struck many buildings. Once they were struck with lightning the buildings usually burned to the ground. Franklin realized that if you stuck a metal pole above the roof of the building and ran a wire from the pole to the ground, the lightning would strike the pole and follow the wire into the ground without burning the building. This invention is still used today and has saved countless barns, houses, and other buildings. The Almanac: This is a book full of helpful facts. Show your child an almanac. If you don't have one get one from the library and be sure to remind your child that Ben Franklin invented the concept of the lending library. Look through the almanac together and find some interesting facts. Helping other people is something anyone can do. 2.  How did Amos (a tiny little mouse) help Ben (a big man)? Talking about it: Because he was so small, Amos was able to reach into places that Ben couldn't. Amos could move around quickly, like in the printing press. He also helped Ben invent bifocals and the Franklin stove. He is the one who discovered electricity and gave Ben the idea for the Pennsylvania Gazette. He assisted Ben in answering Ben's fan mail. Point out that children can be very helpful, too. Your child should, from an early age, have some small chores to do around the house. Use this as an occasion for praise and tell your child how much you appreciate his or her help. Ben Franklin was an admirable person. 3.  Why was Ben Franklin so important to American history? What kinds of things did he do for our country? Talking about it: He was one of the leaders of the Revolution. He invented many important things that we still use today. Without him, we wouldn't have electricity! He also showed the rest of the world that Americans were smart, important and deserved their independence. 4.  There have been many wise men and women who have contributed to our country. These include Ben Franklin, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Graham Bell, Clara Barton, and Betsy Ross. Look up information about these great people online or check out books from the library about important men and women in American history. Ben Franklin's Aphorisms. Benjamin Franklin coined many aphorisms. These are wise sayings that can be put into one sentence. A few are set out below. Tell your child what they mean. Have your child memorize some of them. A penny saved is a penny earned. Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise. Doing nothing for others is the undoing of ourselves. God helps those who help themselves. Little strokes fell great oaks. A good example is the best sermon. The nearest way to come to glory, is to do that for conscience which we would do for glory. The noblest question in the world is: ""What good may I do in it?"" Sell not virtue to purchase wealth nor liberty to purchase power. If thou injurest conscience, it will have its revenge on thee. Fear to do ill [wrong] and you need fear nothing else.   If you talk to your child about two or three of these topics, you'll be doing great! Encourage open-ended discussion and child-initiated questions. You might open with a general question like ""How did you like the movie? Did you have a favorite part?"" or ""Was there anything that confused or surprised you?"" Building Vocabulary Bifocals, glasses, stove, inventor, exploration, experiment, historical, electricity, almanac, newspaper, gazette, history.

MOVIES ON RELATED TOPICS: For a movie about another mouse who emigrated to the U.S. more than a hundred years after Amos came to America, see An American Tail. This movie is a good introduction to the experience of immigrants who came to the U.S. in the period 1880 - 1924. A good movie about inventors is Edison - The Wizard of Light. To enhance your child's growth and development, engage in two or more of the activities listed below: expand vocabulary with conversation and word games; See the Phrases Using Vocabulary Words Section; ask challenging questions about the video; See Discussion Questions below; talk about what's going on in the characters' minds; teach good habits from the themes of the movie. Activities: retell the story - or better have your child retell it; make up new stories with the characters and themes from the video; play with stuffed animals and toys; draw pictures; take field trips; read related books; and act out the stories. For more activities, see Ideas for Playing and Talking -- Developmental and Educational Advancement for Children 3 to 8. Story Time Retell the story at bedtime, on a rainy day, or at any quiet time. Feel free to add different things that happened to Ben and Amos. Make up a story about how Ben was captured and put in jail by the British because of his activities on behalf of the American Revolution. Have Amos be instrumental in picking the lock on his jail house door and allowing Ben to escape. Give them many kinds of mishaps along the way, like almost getting recaptured, running into a British cat that tried to stop them, and so on as far as you want to go.   Social-Emotional Learning Discussion Questions: FRIENDSHIP 1.  Why did Amos leave Ben after the kite and electricity experiment? Was he right to leave? Talking about it: Amos left because Ben was not acting as a friend when he sent Amos to do very dangerous things. Although Amos had offered Ben his help, he had to draw the line somewhere. Amos was right to leave Ben, and Ben realized that he had been responsible for hurting Amos. After a little while, Amos returned and forgave Ben, and the two were able to work together again.   Character Counts Discussion Questions: Discussion Questions Relating to Ethical Issues will facilitate the use of this film to teach ethical principles and critical viewing. Additional questions are set out below. CITIZENSHIP (Do your share to make your school and community better; Cooperate; Stay informed; vote; Be a good neighbor; Obey laws and rules; Respect authority; Protect the environment) See question at Theme Topic #3.   Teachwithmovies.com is a Character Counts ""Six Pillars Partner"" and uses The Six Pillars of Character to organize ethical principles. Character Counts and the Six Pillars of Character are marks of the CHARACTER COUNTS! Coalition, a project of the Josephson Institute of Ethics. Bridges to Reading: This film was derived from a delightful book by Robert Lawson. Children who are excellent readers in the 3rd grade and good readers in the 4th and 5th grades can read it themselves. Robert Lawson has written several excellent books for children ages 7 - 12 telling stories of famous individuals through the eyes of animals, including: Mr Revere and I and Captain Kidd's Cat.

Age: 12+; Middle and High School Levels; MPAA Rating: PG; 1988; Romantic Comedy; 104 Minutes; Color; Available from Amazon.com. Josh's quest to return to childhood fits the pattern of the Hero?s Journey, a basic paradigm of human experience described by mythologist Joseph Campbell. Also called ""the Monomyth"" and the story of the quest, the Hero's Journey relies heavily on Carl Jung's insights into humanity's collective psychology. See TWM's student handout Stages and Archetypes of the Hero?s Journey — Introducing the Monomyth. TWM has also created a Hero?s Journey Worksheet to help students identify the stages and archetypes in any story in which the protagonist is embarked on an important quest. This Lesson Plan provides notes on responses when the worksheet is applied to Josh's journey to the understanding that childhood is a time to be treasured and a necessary stage in the road to adulthood. The Lesson Plan also contains suggested assignments. This lesson can be used to: (1) confirm and extend students' prior knowledge of the Hero's Journey or (2) serve as a summative assessment in a unit about the Hero's Journey. Length:       The movie is 104 minutes. The amount of class time needed will depend upon the length of class discussions, the number of assignments, and how many of those assignments are given as homework. TWM estimates that the lesson will take at least four 45 to 55 minute class periods. Learner Outcomes/Objectives:     Students will describe the stages and archetypes of the Hero's Journey manifested in a romantic comedy describing a quest for personal growth. In addition, by completing one or more of the suggested assignments, students will employ and perfect the writing skills required by ELA curriculum standards. Rationale:     Stories told on screens are the literature of today's youth. Students will have an extra quantum of interest in applying the concept of the Hero's Journey and performing related ELA assignments with respect to a romantic comedy. The Monomyth is a basic paradigm of human experience that is frequently used in written stories, drama, and film. Viewing stories involving a successful and important quest in different contexts will expand and deepen students' understanding of the role of the Hero's Journey in fiction and in life.

47,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/billy-budd.html,"This film is a brilliant adaptation of Herman Melville's novella about a young man who is impressed from a merchant ship to a Royal Navy frigate. The story is set in 1797, during a war between royalist Britain and revolutionary France. The American and French revolutions have cast aside old concepts of authority and recent mutinies in the Royal Navy threaten hopes for military victory as well as the lives of the officers aboard ship. Billy Budd is innocent, gentle, and friendly. He is pitted against the ship's Master at Arms, Claggart, who is evil, cruel and determined to destroy Billy. When Claggart falsely accuses Billy of planning a mutiny, Billy responds with a blow to Claggart's head that results in the death of the Master at Arms. Adhering to the Articles of War, a set of harsh rules designed to assure order aboard ship, the ship's captain has Billy tried, convicted and hanged for the crime. The trial offers insight into the conflict between justice and law, responsibility to duty verses adherence to a personal moral code, and the struggle between good and evil. Benefits of the Movie:     For classes in English Language Arts: The film is an excellent tool to access Herman Melville's novella. The book, numbering fewer than 100 pages, is dense and difficult for modern readers. Still, it is well worth the struggle necessary to navigate complicated sentences and to process obsolete and esoteric vocabulary. The themes are as important today as ever they were; the characters are clear and extant in modern society. For social studies classes: The movie provides an accurate and vivid account of the impressment of seamen by the Royal Navy, life on warships at the end of the 18th century, and tensions in British society caused by the revolutionary spirit of the age. Situations in which the law conflicts with justice and when the obligations of duty conflict with a citizen's personal moral code are important issues for civics classes. Media literacy: Since ""Billy Budd"" is filmed in black and white, students can become better critics of film by learning to appreciate the use of contrasting shades of light, out of which comes much of the film's artistic merit. For example, clothing worn, overhead settings, use of ropes and angles and patterns of light all cause the viewers to focus on what the director, Peter Ustinov, intends to be the most important matter in the film: the contrast between the beauty of innocence and the ugliness of evil.",,"For classes in English Language Arts: The film is an excellent tool to access Herman Melville's novella.

Age: 14+; MPAA Rating -- Not Rated; Drama; 1962; 119 minutes; Black and White. Available from Amazon.com. Both Herman Melville and Henry David Thoreau are essential to the study of American literature. Looking at Melville's Billy Budd in relation to Thoreau's essay, Resistance to Civil Government, will help students make connections between various parts of the American literature curriculum and enhance their appreciation for both works. Captain Vere and each member of the court martial jury had the opportunity to do justice by following conscience rather than strictly following the Articles of War. Yet, they did not take that path. This Learning Guide suggests that the lesson culminate in an essay assignment requiring students to demonstrate an understanding of the concept of civil disobedience described in Thoreau's essay and the conflict between law and justice explored in Billy Budd. This Guide also contains a Movie Questionnaire to keep students on task as they watch film, a transcript of parts of the court martial, additional discussion questions, additional assignments and a comparison of the film and the novella. The lessons suggested in this Guide are designed to supplement what teachers normally present in their study of Thoreau.

48,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/billy-elliot.html,"Billy, the 11-year-old son of an English mining family, stumbles onto a ballet class held in the same community center as his boxing lessons. Billy's family is under tremendous strain. His mother has just died. Billy's grandmother has a tendency to wander off and cannot take care of herself. Billy's father, a miner of limited education, and his older brother, are walking the picket lines during the violent and unsuccessful 1984 British miner's strike. There is little money. Billy's father doesn't approve of boys taking ballet, while Billy finds that he would rather dance than do anything else. Will Billy pursue his dream? Will the beleaguered Elliot family pull together and heal? Benefits of the Movie: This warmhearted story shows children the rewards of perseverance in following their own star despite parental or popular opinion. It demonstrates the redemptive agency of love in a family under enormous stress and shows a father coming through as a parent after some egregious errors. The film illuminates the tensions and sorrows of a family dealing with the loss of its wife and mother while the grandmother gently sinks into senility. (Billy lovingly takes care of his grandmother.) In this film a friendship between two boys survives the fact that one is homosexual and the other probably is not. ""Billy Elliot"" also illustrates the far-reaching influence that a dedicated teacher can have on a child's development. The family's struggle is set against the background of the 1984 English coal miner's strike in which the British government, determined to drastically reform the country's bloated and inefficient coal industry, crushed the miner's union, and changed English society. The film reveals the sacrifices required of striking union workers and their families, as well as the anguish of a community whose way of life is doomed in the face of new economic conditions.",,"This warmhearted story shows children the rewards of perseverance in following their own star despite parental or popular opinion.

Profanity pervades the dialogue. Billy's father and older brother Tony curse continually. Billy and his friend Michael curse matter-of-factly. Though softened by an English North Country/Scottish Border accent, the f... word, pronounced as rhyming with ""cook,"" is heard in every sentence of some speeches. See Discussion Question #19. The family pulls together in the end, but not before violent arguments. In one of them, the father, pushed to his limits by not being able to support his family, by the strike, by the recent death of his wife, by having to raise a child he cannot understand, and by many other events beyond his control, throws Billy against a wall. The father also hits his older son, an adult, drawing blood in a futile attempt to stop the young man from an early morning foray to damage company property. There are frequent violent clashes between the police and striking miners. Billy hits another child. No gore is shown, and there is no thrill factor to the violence in this film. No serious injury is suffered by anyone in these incidents. Billy defies his father and surreptitiously attends dance classes. While some parents might object to this part of the story, we see it as a strength. The father's insistence that Billy box rather than take ballet restricted the growth and development of his child. Had Billy complied with that instruction, he would have missed his life's calling. In other words, the parent was wrong in such a fundamental way that the child's disobedience was justified. Billy's best friend Michael tries on women's clothing, as the film reveals his nascent homosexuality. The film accepts Michael's homosexuality without any negative implication. Some parents may object to anything other than a negative portrayal of homosexuality. However, Billy, who appears to be heterosexual, is able to gently decline Michael's advances and set boundaries to their relationship. In this way, the film provides an excellent model for the maintenance of friendships between people who are substantially different. In addition, the juxtaposition of Billy, who dances and is heterosexual, with Michael, who is homosexual but does not dance, demonstrates the fallacy of stereotyping the sexual orientations of male ballet dancers. We see the film's treatment of this friendship as a strength of the movie. The film shows a community at odds with its government. The strikers protest and the police attack. A striker moons the police. This incident distracts a librarian while Billy steals a book on ballet that the librarian would not let him check out. The police are a constant and malevolent presence. There is a lot of smoking in the film. Why recommend this film with all of these possible problems? The reason is twofold. First, pervading the film and triumphing at the end is the essential human quality of loving and caring for others. Second, the film has many positive lessons, and, except for the profanity and the smoking, each possible problem has a strong and corresponding benefit. Parenting Points:     Review the Helpful Background section so that you can answer questions that may arise as your child watches the film.

This Learning Guide contains materials for teaching the novel as well as the movie. The more students know about pre-WWII Germany, the Holocaust, the Blitz, and the Allies' devastating response, the more they will appreciate Markus Zusak's world-wide best-seller. Thus, TWM suggests cooperation between ELA and history instructors. However, the Guide also provides the basic historical background that can be used by ELA teachers when there is no opportunity to coordinate with a history instructor. This Guide includes reports of actual events on which a few episodes in the story are based. These increase the veracity of both the novel and the film. Description: The Book Thief is the tale of a young orphan named Liesel and the people who love her in a small German town just before and during WWII. The story shows that the power of love overcomes tragedy and hardship. Set among civilians living in Nazi Germany, The Book Thief demonstrates that even among a vicious and feared enemy there are valuable people of character. The story leads the reader/viewer to a new understanding of the abrupt and indiscriminate death caused by aerial bombardment of civilian communities. Rationale for Using the Movie: When shown after the book has been read, the movie allows teachers to confirm lessons taught using the novel and to demonstrate how a book and its adaptation to film can be independent works of art. For classes in which reading levels do not permit students to experience the novel, the movie is an excellent example of cinematic literature from which lessons about a character-driven story, plot, irony, and theme can be crafted. Objectives/Student Outcomes Using this Learning Guide: Students will gain new understanding of the power of love and the horrors of war. In ELA classes students will be exposed to the important themes set out in the story, be able to analyze a character-driven story, derive its themes, and explore the use of irony. Both novel and movie offer good occasions for discussion and writing assignments. For history classes the story will provide a vivid added dimension to events in Germany before and during WWII, especially of the Allies' aerial bombardment of Germany.

Bruno is told by his family that the camp is a farm and refers to the uniforms of the incarcerated Jews as ""striped pajamas."" Slowly and reluctantly he comes to know part of the truth about the camp and his father. Bruno's attempt to make up for an earlier betrayal of his friend causes Bruno to don the ""pajamas"" and sneak into the camp to help search for Shmuel's lost father.

Learner Outcomes/Objectives:    Students will be able to relate the powerful attraction of black holes as seen in film to the concept of gravity. They will understand why they are named with the word ""black"" and be able to explain it in terms of the concept of escape velocity. Rationale:     Star Trek is one of the few movies to have any success in representing the gravitational forces caused by black holes. Description of the Film Clips:     The first clip shows the destruction of planet Vulkan after a black hole has been created in its core using the fictional ""red matter"". The planet collapses in a matter of minutes. The second clip shows a star going supernova and destroying an inhabited planet in the explosion. Spock tries to counteract the supernova creating a black hole at its centre with the ""red matter"". Clip # 3 shows the Starship Enterprise in pursuit of the enemy. The latter is engulfed by the black hole and the Enterprise narrowly escapes its gravitational attraction by reaching the necessary speed. Helpful Background:     The first point to address in this context is the fact that gravitational force is related to mass. In fact the relation is very simple: gravitational attraction is directly proportional to the mass of the object. It is also easily understandable that the attraction will be stronger nearer the object and weaker further away. A useful analogy would be the heat felt around a fire. The larger the fire the stronger the heat, and it will feel hotter near the fire than further away. Normally if a spaceship feels pulled towards an attracting object like a planet or a star, it can be accelerated to move away from the pulling object. But if the object is very large there is a distance from the surface below which the maximum speed of the spaceship will not be enough to escape the attraction. Let us think of the attraction of the Earth. A stone thrown upwards with our bare hands will always fall back down. We will never be able to give it enough speed so that it will escape into space. So, what is it that objects need to escape from the surface of the Earth? Let us consider objects we know that actually manage to escape from the Earth's gravitational pull: rockets. To escape from the Earth the rocket needs to reach a certain speed. Anything reaching that certain speed will be able to travel into outer space (be it a rocket or a stone). This speed, called the escape velocity, is 11.2 kilometers per second or 25,950 miles per hour at the surface of the Earth, decreasing with distance from the Earth. Now let us think back and see if we can find anything else that is able to escape the gravitational pull of the Earth. Yes, there is something else that can travel into space: light. We know it because when seen from space the Earth shines, reflecting the light from the sun. See for example the unique photograph taken by the space probe Voyager II when it was pointed back at the Earth to take a final farewell picture. It was the first photograph taken where both the Earth and the Moon appear together as seen from a distance. It can be viewed together with more recent ones at Photos of the Earth and Moon ? From Other Worlds. A further proof that light is able to leave the Earth is the phenomenon called ""Earthshine:"" the glow of the Earth as it reflects the light from the Sun. Earthshine can light up the dark side of the moon. The adequate conditions to see this happen occasionally and it is a beautiful view to enjoy. It also makes for beautiful photographs: you just need to Google ""Earthshine"" to obtain an extensive gallery of images. Finally, there is further evidence that light is able to escape from the pull of the Earth from the Apollo moon missions. The astronauts left behind on the Moon a small mirror to which a laser beam (light) is pointed regularly to monitor the gradual change in the distance between the Moon and the Earth. This distance is established by measuring how long it takes the laser beam to travel to the Moon and back after it is reflected on that mirror. More details about this can be obtained at What Neil & Buzz Left on the Moon. So, we know now that rockets and light have speeds high enough to overcome the gravity of the Earth and escape into space from its surface. As we said before, the gravitational force that a lump of matter exerts depends upon its mass. This means that more massive objects will have stronger gravitational pulls and higher speeds will be necessary to escape from the gravity of those objects. And as we consider higher and higher masses we reach an object massive enough so that its gravitational pull will not even allow light to escape from its surface. But we also know that nothing can travel faster than light, so what happens then? Well, then nothing, not even light itself can escape the object from below this limit ? the Event Horizon. We then have a black hole. And it is not called ""black"" because there is no light on it ? it is just that light cannot leave the black hole for us to see it: it ""falls"" back down just like a stone thrown upwards on Earth. As mentioned above, only very massive objects can be a black hole. For example certain massive stars become black holes once the thermonuclear reactions in their core run out of fuel and the stars cease to shine, breaking the equilibrium between the outward push from their radiation and the inward pull from gravity, in favour of the latter. The star is then left entirely to gravity. The subsequent collapse gets rid of the lighter stuff when it rebounds into space in the form of a formidable supernova explosion and leaves the very heavy matter behind, collapsing even further into a dense sphere of remnant matter that becomes a black hole. Once in place such a black hole is certainly a place to be avoided by passing spaceships. This is why it is such an interesting place for science fiction! In the film Star Trek, the villain creates a back hole inside the planet Vulcan using the so-called ""red matter"". The black hole devours the whole planet in a matter of seconds. Red matter and making black holes are of course fictional, but there were concerns about mini black holes being formed as a by-product of the subatomic collisions that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) run by the European Particle Laboratory CERN in Geneva (Switzerland) was meant to create. Although theoretically these mini black-holes were plausible, their formation is highly unlikely and in fact have not happened since the LHC started operating. The controversy however made it necessary for CERN to address mini black-holes in a press release aimed at dissipating unfounded concerns in the public: The safety of the LHC.",Black Holes,65,B002PMPTIO

73,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/les-choristes.html,"The time is shortly after WWII; the place is somewhere in rural France at Fond de L'Etang (The Bottom of the Pond), a school for boys with discipline problems or whose families cannot keep them. ""Les Choristes"" tells the story of Pierre Morhange, a student with undiscovered musical talent, and Mssr. Mathieu, a frustrated musician who serves as the dean of discipline. Opposing the school's strict methods of controlling the students, Mathieu begins to use music to affect change in the rowdy and ill-natured boys. The successful effort to create a choir, with Morhange as the featured soloist, changes the students and the teacher. As sometimes occurs with innovative and inspiring teachers, Mathieu is fired. Benefits of the Movie:     Students will empathize with the young characters in the film and benefit from the demonstration of hope and caring that constitute the theme. English Language Arts classes can focus on explicating translations of the poems that constitute lyrics for the songs O Nuit! and Vois Sur Ton Chemin. This Guide provides exercises using the ""say, mean, matter"" method of analysing poetry. ""Les Choristes"" also provides excellent opportunities for students to discuss or write about themes in a story. See the discussion questions. ELA standards in all states require students to be able to find meaning in a poem, to ferret out the theme and ideas in a story, and to write about their conclusions. French Language Classes will benefit when students translate the lyrics of songs from ""Les Choristes"". Students can then practice their skills in French by writing explications of the poems. See Explication of the Lyrics of Two Songs. The discussion questions can prompt interesting exchanges and many can serve as writing prompts for essays in the language of the film. Music classes and choirs may benefit from improved motivation and esprit de corps after watching this film. Students can also be asked to trace the history of children's choirs, both in Europe and the United States. Presentations can be made using YouTube or actual recordings of famous choirs such as the Vienna Boy's Choir or the several choirs made up of young people that are based in American cities.

Description:     The time is shortly after WWII; the place is somewhere in rural France at Fond de L'Etang (The Bottom of the Pond), a school for boys with discipline problems or whose families cannot keep them. ""Les Choristes"" tells the story of Pierre Morhange, a student with undiscovered musical talent, and Mssr. Mathieu, a frustrated musician who serves as the dean of discipline. Opposing the school's strict methods of controlling the students, Mathieu begins to use music to affect change in the rowdy and ill-natured boys.

Their relationship comes under great strain when their fathers take opposing positions in the intra-Jewish debate over whether to establish a secular Jewish state in Palestine. The story is narrated by Reuven, whose father is a professor arguing for the creation of the state of Israel, but is focused on Danny, an intellectual Hasid who wants to study psychology in a secular university. Danny is pressured mightily by his father, a charismatic Hasidic Rabbi who has raised his son in ""silence"" and expects him to carry on the rabbinical dynasty established generations ago in Poland. Benefits of the Movie: Adapted from the 1967 award-winning novel by Chaim Potok, ""The Chosen"" is a compelling story of friends, fathers and sons, and assimilation into mainstream Western culture.

Parenting Points:     Unless your child is reading the novel from which the film was adapted in class, enjoy the film with your child and point out how religious tolerance and the nature of friendship and forgiving are important areas of reflection for young people. If your child is reading the novel in class, watch the film after the reading has been completed. Helpful Background The roots of Hasidism, a sect of Judaism, is adequately covered in the novel but is largely absent from the film. It may be useful in classes that do not read the book to require students to read chapter six, in which Reuven Malter's father explains the development of Hasidism. He addresses the split between the Jews in terms of support for the creation of the state of Israel and explains the anger expressed by Rabbi Saunders, Danny's father, who believes that the state of Israel can only be established when the Messiah returns. On this basis, he opposes a secular Jewish state. A number of esoteric terms must be understood, however, for students to follow the film: Hasidim: This term means ""pious ones"" in Hebrew. They are an ultra orthodox sect of Jews who believe in prayer, joy, personal experience, ecstatic prayer, and mysticism. They often express their faith in song and dance. The sect developed in Eastern Europe in the mid-1700s. In the first half of the nineteenth century, when Hasidism was at its height, it was practiced by millions of Jews in Eastern and Central Europe. Torah: The teachings of the Jews consisting of the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible. Talmud: The book of commentaries and scriptural interpretations that make up the body of knowledge found in the Torah. Tzaddik: A righteous Jewish man who acts as a mediator between the Jews and their creator. Gematriya: The practice of determining meaning in words by assigning each letter a numerical value which they can be manipulated into new words and altered meaning. Resolution 181: In 1947, the United Nations passed a resolution that partitioned the British Mandate of Palestine into two separate states, one Jewish and the other Arab. Jerusalem and Bethlehem were to fall under international authority. Whereas the Jews accepted the resolution, the Arab majority living in the area did not. At one point in the story Reuven spends the night packing guns in crates marked ""Farm Equipment"". The guns were being sent to the armed Jewish resistance in Palestine. Since the British controlled Palestine and the guns were going to be used against British soldiers, as well as to protect Jews from Arabs, this act was illegal and against stated U.S. government policy. The British considered the armed Jewish resistance, the Irgun and the Hagana, to be terrorists. Aiding and abetting terrorists is clearly illegal. However, in the years preceding the adoption of U.N. Resolution 181 in 1948, the U.S. supported the creation of the state of Israel and U.S. customs officials did not try to stop people from sending guns to help the Jews in Palestine.",,"LEARNING GUIDE TO: THE CHOSEN SUBJECTS Literature/U.S. & Literary Devices/Theme; Symbol; Irony;         Religions/Judaism; U.S.: 1941 - 1945 & New York; SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL LEARNING — Parenting; Father/Son; Friendship;         Breaking Out; MORAL-ETHICAL EMPHASIS — Respect; Caring.

The story also provides a harsh critique of conditions in England at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Possible Problems:     MINOR. Very young children (ages 5 - 8) may be frightened by the ghosts. Parenting Points:     Show your child the location of England on a map or a globe. For younger children (ages 8 & 9), explain that in the early 1800s, the time this story took place, conditions for workers in England were very poor. Many farmers were moving to the city and there were more people who wanted work than there were jobs. Employers could keep wages very low. If an employee asked for more pay, the employer could easily find someone else who was willing to work for the low wage the employer wanted to pay. ""A Christmas Carol"" is a great story of Christmas and how a man changed from being selfish to being generous. When it was first published, almost 200 years ago, the author also wanted to change the selfish attitudes of the wealthy of that time. For children about ten years of age or older, describe the information set out in the Helpful Background section. After the movie, ask and help your child to answer the Quick Discussion Question and several of the other Discussion Questions that might interest them. The book is not long.

83,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/contagion.html,"This movie describes a fictional influenza pandemic: the origin of the virus, the human toll, the response of the public health agencies, and the various reactions of people to a public health emergency. The film is a reasonable prediction of what would occur in the event of a moderately lethal influenza pandemic. Possible Problems:     Minor. Scenes of people dying from the flu may disturb some students. SUGGESTED LESSON PLAN USING THIS FILM: Subject:     Health - infectious disease; influenza; pandemics. Level:          Grades 9 - 12. Learner Outcomes/Objectives:     Students will understand the risks to modern society from the influenza virus and see a realistic scenario of what might occur in case of moderately lethal influenza pandemic. Students will learn to use the Internet to obtain information on illnesses from various websites, including www.cdc.gov from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and www.flu.gov from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS). Rationale:     An influenza pandemic is one of the greatest threats to modern global society. Working through scenarios of catastrophic situations help students think in advance about how to react to them. The websites of the CDC and HHS contain important information about health issues and will be a resource for students throughout their lives. Into Step 1: Make students aware of the Potential Problems of Influenza Pandemics: This can be accomplished in a number of ways. The teacher can provide direct instruction on pandemics by way of an introduction to the film; see Pandemics below. Individual students, or groups of students can be assigned to research and give class presentations on topics such as: (a) each of the influenza pandemics of the last 100 years,(b) the H5N1 Avian Flu, (c) the efforts of agencies such as the CDC and WHO to combat the influenza virus, and (d) influenza vaccines. Another alternative is to require students to research the Spanish Flu influenza pandemic of 1918/1919 and write a short essay. TWM suggests that teachers require that some of the research be on the Internet with sources cited. The length of the paper, its structure, and the scaffolding necessary will depend upon the level of the class. Consider enlisting an ELA teacher to make the essay an assignment for English class. Use the rubric usually used in written work for the class or get one from an ELA teacher. Make sure the class is informed that: (1) The mortality rate from the H5N1 Avian influenza virus is very high, from 30% to 80% of the people infected have died from the disease. Fortunately, it has spread only to several hundred people. (2) 20 to 50 million people died from the Spanish Flu influenza pandemic of 1918/1919. This information will be asked of students if they take the Comprehension test. Step 2: Get Students Thinking: Ask students, as they watch the movie, to think about how they would react in the various situations shown in the film? Through Step 3: Play the Movie: Teachers who want to use a movie worksheet,can download TWM's Film Study Worksheet for a Documentary. The only modification necessary will be to change the title and to delete the following language from question #4, ""Nonfiction can enrich viewers in several important ways."" Otherwise, the worksheet is well-suited for this film without further modification. Step 4: Class Discussion: Immediately after the movie, start a discussion about whether the right thing to do in a pandemic situation is to obey the instructions of the authorities or to do whatever you can for your family or loved ones, even if it frustrates the efforts of the authorities. You can raise this issue with the following question, ""In this film, the people from the Chinese village took the law into their own hands in their attempts to survive. One of the characters, Dr. Cheever, gave a female relative advance notice to leave a city about to be quarantined. Were these efforts to survive wrong? What would you have done? Step 5: Influenza Internet Research: Have students search the Internet to obtain brief authoritative information on the following subjects that are covered by the comprehension test set out below: influenza symptoms, how it spreads, treatment for influenza, why flu shots change every year, the most common complication of influenza, seasonal flu, sources of new strains of the influenza virus, the two criteria for assessing the dangerousness of a strain of the virus, and influenza pandemics of the last 100 years. Students should be required to use the websites of the CDC and HHS as well other sources. Students should be required to take notes on what they found, citing their sources. These notes should be turned in to make sure that the work has been performed. Step 6: Test or Concluding Assignment: The culmination of the Lesson can be a Comprehension Test. TWM recommends that the day before the test, teachers go over questions 1 - 8 (or the topics of these questions) with the class so that students will know what to focus on when they study. Another possibility for a concluding assignment is to require students to write an essay on the results of their research from Step 5 divided into sections on symptoms, prevention and treatment, citing sources. Students should be required to obtain information from the CDC and HHS websites, as well as others.

Beyond Students can perform in-depth research on the human toll of the 1918/1919 Spanish Flu pandemic and then choose from a number of projects: (1) create a work of art such as a song, a story, a poem, a drawing, a dance or a collage of photographs, describing the effects of the pandemic or (2) write a research report on the experience of their hometown during the pandemic. ADVERTISEMENT Helpful Background Seven Types of Symptoms of Influenza Influenza is a respiratory disease with symptoms that last one to two weeks. Types of influenza symptoms include: A fever or feeling feverish (although not everyone with the flu has a fever) A cough and/or sore throat A runny or stuffy nose Headaches and/or body aches Chills Fatigue Nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea (most common in children) The flu and the common cold have similar symptoms, and it can be difficult to tell them apart. In general, the flu is worse than the common cold. Symptoms such as fever, body aches, tiredness, and cough are more common and intense with the flu. People with colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose. Health care providers have a test that can determine whether a patient is suffering from the flu or a common cold. For more information, go to Seasonal Flu — Symptoms. Prevention The flu spreads when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks and droplets containing the influenza virus are inhaled by another person. The flu can also spread when a person touches an object or a surface which has the virus on it and then touches his or her mouth, eyes or nose. The best defense against the flu is vaccination. Other preventive measures are to live a healthy life style and particularly get enough sleep and to eat well. Stay away from people who are ill. When exposed, see a physician about getting an antiviral drug. These drugs are more effective the sooner they are taken and can be beneficial to reduce symptoms if they are taken up to two days after a person becomes ill. The incubation period from first infection until the onset of symptom is 1 - 4 days, averaging two days, in adults who will shed influenza virus beginning one day before they start to have symptoms through the next 5 - 10 days. (These figures are probably the same for otherwise healthy teenagers.) Young children and severely immunocompromised persons can shed virus for longer periods. For more information, go to Seasonal Flu — Prevention. Treatment Treatment for the flu starts with bed rest, drinking clear fluids such as water, broth, electrolyte beverages (sports drinks) to prevent dehydration, and taking over-the-counter medicines to help with symptoms. A humidifier can also make breathing easier. Salt water gargles (1:1 ratio warm water to salt) will help with sore throats. Fevers and aches can be reduced with over-the-counter pain relievers and wet cool washcloths applied to forehead, arms and legs. For all medications, be sure to read the label and don't take too much. Pharmacists can be helpful if there are any questions. Be especially careful of acetaminophen (Tylenol®) because it is found in many combination preparations and overdosing can cause serious liver damage. Note that antibiotics do not protect against viruses such as the flu. However, they can be helpful if a secondary bacterial infection develops. The most common complications of the flu are bacterial pneumonia, ear and sinus infections, dehydration, and the worsening of chronic illnesses. Seek medical attention immediately if any of the following symptoms appear: Fever over 102 degrees or fever lasts longer than three days Difficulty breathing, wheezing when breathing, or shortness of breath Purple or blue discoloration of the lips Pain or pressure in the chest, abdomen or neck; severe head-ache; Sudden dizziness Confusion Severe or persistent vomiting Seizures flu symptoms that worsen each day; Flu-like symptoms that improve but then return with fever and worse cough People who have the following chronic illnesses should seek medical help as soon as flu symptoms appear: heart disease, asthma, COPD, diabetes, or HIV/AIDS. Do not treat this information as medical advice. The above descriptions of symptom paraphrases several apparently authoritative web-sites such as Seasonal Flu — Treatment from the CDC; Flu: What to do if you get sick from the CDC, and When to Call the Doctor About the Flu from WebMD.",Contagion,85,B0069UP2PI

86,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/courage-under-fire.html,"Set in the 1991 Desert Storm conflict and its aftermath, this film is the fictional story of the first woman to receive a Medal of Honor for heroism in combat. A subplot concerns the destruction of a U.S. Army tank by friendly fire and its effect on the man responsible. Benefits of the Movie: In addition to exploring the role of women in combat and casualties from friendly fire, this movie contains lessons about alcohol abuse, honesty, redemption, leadership, and the effect of the military macho doctrine of ""I can handle it without help"" on the marriages of army officers. ""Courage Under Fire"" can lead to discussions on these topics. Possible Problems:     SERIOUS. This is a war movie with frequent profanity and some death. The brief view of the tank commander's charred body is gruesome but there is artistic justification for this since the tragedy of his death is a driving force of the plot. Alcohol abuse is shown. The villain, Monfriez, when confronted with his crime, commits suicide by driving his truck into an oncoming train. It should be pointed out to children who see this film that every time Monfriez is called upon to make any moral or life affecting decision, he makes the wrong choice. Parenting Points:     Most children will be interested in discussing several of the lessons presented by this movie. Start by talking about the differences between the actions of Serling and Monfriez. Colonel Serling changes and grows through the story. Monfriez does not. As an example of how Serling grew, ask the Quick Discussion Question. Go over some of the poor decisions made by Monfriez: two of the big ones are lying so that Captain Walden would be left for dead and committing suicide when he was caught. Then go to the Social-Emotional Learning Discussion Questions. Don't worry if you can only get through a few questions. Just taking the film seriously and discussing some of the lessons in the movie is the key. TeachWithMovies.com recommends that every child in any family in which there is any history of heavy drinking or alcohol abuse be taken to an open AA meeting beginning at the age of 12 or 13. This should be repeated every year or so. Some meetings are divided into two parts. Try to stay for the second part.

He is also told that animal agriculture and the crops necessary to feed those animals consume more than 50% of the potable water in the U.S. and that a hamburger with 1/3rd of a pound of beef requires 660 gallons of water to produce. As he digs deeper into the literature about the environmental costs of animal agriculture, he learns about the deforestation of the Amazon to grow crops to feed livestock, the pollution caused by the many hundred million tons of animal waste generated by the industry each year, and the antibiotic resistance caused by pumping livestock full of antibiotics to prevent disease among animals closely confined in large numbers. Then he learns that hunger in the world would be eliminated if the grain that is fed to farm animals were available for human consumption. The activist wonders why he can't read anything about animal agriculture on the websites and in the literature of some major environmental organizations. He questions why government agencies charged with reducing pollution don't publicize these facts and encourage people to reduce their intake of meat and dairy.

THE POWER OF THE ANIMAL AGRICULTURE LOBBY Excerpts from: In Final Spending Bill, Salty Food and Belching Cows Are Winners By Robert Pear, New York Times, December 14, 2014. [B]uried in the giant spending bill that cleared the Senate on Saturday and [that] is headed to President Obama for his signature were provisions that prohibit the federal government from requiring less salt in school lunches and allow schools to obtain exemptions from whole-grain requirements for pasta and tortillas. The watered-down standards for school meals were a setback for the first lady, Michelle Obama, who had vowed to fight ""until the bitter end"" for tougher nutrition standards. . . . The National Cattlemen's Beef Association scored several victories that require the government to keep its regulatory hands off farms and ranches. The bill says the government cannot require farmers to report ""greenhouse gas emissions"" from manure ""management systems."" Nor can it require ranchers to obtain greenhouse gas permits for ""methane emissions"" produced by bovine flatulence or belching. The Environmental Protection Agency says on its website that ""globally, the agriculture sector is the primary source"" of methane emissions. The spending bill requires the E.P.A. to withdraw a new rule defining how the Clean Water Act applies to certain agricultural conservation practices. It also prevents the Army Corps of Engineers from regulating farm ponds and irrigation ditches under the Clean Water Act. This is a major victory for farmers and ranchers, who consistently tell many of us that they are concerned about the potential of the E.P.A. and the Army Corps of Engineers' overreach into their operations,"" Representative Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho, said.",Cowspiracy,90,

While the Oscar nominated documentary , ,,, Students will get a feeling for the relative sizes and distances of stars and of galaxies and of the vastness of space as compared to the small world of planet Earth. ,"SNIPPET LESSON PLAN FOR: Interstellar and Intergalactic Distances Using Cosmic Voyage Subject:     Science & Technology; Astronomy — Interstellar and Intergalactic Distances Ages:          10+; Late Elementary to High School Length:      Film Clip: approximately 12 minutes or a shorter clip of approximately five minutes will also work; Lesson: One 50 minute class period. Learner Outcomes/Objectives:     Students will get a feeling for the relative sizes and distances of stars and of galaxies and of the vastness of space as compared to the small world of planet Earth. Rationale:     Cosmic Voyage describes in a very attractive way the huge distances of deep space. Students usually know that stars are in galaxies and that there are huge numbers of galaxies in the universe. However it is usually not so easy to convey a feeling of the relative scales and distance of stars and galaxies: whereas galaxies densely populate the universe, stars are very far away from each other within a galaxy. Description of the Film Clip:    Viewers are taken on a journey through the distances of space changing magnification of one scene by a factor of ten at each step. While the Oscar nominated documentary Cosmic Voyage is certainly worth watching in its entirety (36 minutes), this Snippet Lesson Plan focuses on the sequence running from minutes 9:45 to 12:02 (two minutes and 17 seconds). In this sequence, viewers are taken through increasingly larger distances in space, starting with a view of the sun and then widening the viewer's perspective until the nearest stars, the triple system Alpha Centauri, come into view. By the end of the clip, the viewer's perspective has been widened to include the largest scales of the universe that can be mapped. However, in order to properly understand the rationale of the documentary, TWM recommends that students be shown the film from the end of the opening credits (about 40 seconds into the film) up to the scene that shows the Dutch town of Delft (minute 12:22, about twelve minutes). Helpful Background:     The ""Cosmic Voyage"" taken in the film contains ""landmarks"" to enable the viewer to keep in mind the scale of things in the universe in terms of powers of ten. The journey has two major thresholds: first, the point at which stars begin to be seen in groups, at 1015 meters, and second, when the same thing happens with galaxies, several powers of ten later, at 1023 meters. There is a fundamental difference between these two scales: the distances between stars are huge with respect to their sizes. There are, for example, about one million diameters of the Sun between the Sun and its closest stellar neighbor, Alpha Centauri. It can be said that space within galaxies is virtually empty, except, of course in their very dense centers, where there is evidence for supermassive black holes attracting huge amounts of matter to themselves. Galaxies on the other hand are proportionally very close to each other, on a scale of 25 to 1, where 1 is an average size of a galaxy. It is therefore frequent to see galaxies interacting and colliding, while stars within the galaxies hardly ever do so, not even when two galaxies smash into each other: the stars fly by each other like two swarms of mosquitoes. What smashes, in a collision between galaxies, is their interstellar dust and gas. See an excellent explanation of this with beautiful images from the Hubble Space Telescope: Hubble's Universe Unfiltered — Show One: Interacting Galaxies Galore. There are more visual presentations of galaxy interactions at: Interacting Galaxies from COSMOS - The SAO Encyclopedia of Astronomy. Interacting Stars That there are hardly any collisions between stars does not mean that stars do not interact. When star formation occurs in a gas cloud, the formed stars are gravitationally bound to each other. Sometimes a large number of them stay together as a cluster of stars, and as many as 85% of the stars in the Milky Way Galaxy are in fact binary stars, triplets or multiple systems. There is a minimum mass required before a lump of gas coalesces to become a star. This has been estimated to be between 40 and 80 times the mass contained in Jupiter. In other words, if Jupiter had accumulated about that many times its actual mass when the solar system was formed, it would now be a binary system. Such a situation was imagined in the Star Wars universe, where Luke Skywalker's planet Tatooine has two suns. But would a binary star system be able to have planets in stable orbits, and would living beings be able to experience a double sunset? It seems to have been proven theoretically and observed in practice. Learn more about it at Ask an Astrophysicist . A frequent and well-studied case is that of two interacting stars where one of them is a compact white dwarf star or the collapsed remnant of a star that has ceased to emit energy in the form of heat and light through thermonuclear reactions. The other is a still active star. The collapsed companion has very strong gravity and absorbs huge amounts of gas from the active star. In the case of a white dwarf being the compact companion, the infalling material can trigger a supernova of the type known as Ia (roman numeral ""I"" and the letter ""a""). These supernovae have been very important for astrophysicists over the last decade, because they are known to have a very precise luminosity, and can therefore be used as ""standard candles"" to determine the distances of the galaxies in which they occur: since it is known how bright they always are, the fainter they become, the further away they are. This in turn has allowed astronomers to discover that the expansion of the universe is not only not slowing down (as would be expected due to the mutual gravitational attraction of all objects in it) but in fact it is speeding up! The still mysterious origin of this acceleration of the universe's expansion has been named ""dark energy."" Find out more about supernovae Ia and dark energy at Dark Energy at Hubble Discoveries and the links therein. Galaxies and the Large Scale Structure of the Universe As mentioned above, galaxies do interact and collide. Quite often, in fact. Galaxies come in different shapes, the two main types being ""spiral"" galaxies and ""elliptical"" galaxies. The ""spiral"" shape is usually interpreted as a whirlpool of stars, gas and dust falling into a supermassive black hole at the center. The ""elliptical"" shape is believed to be related to the common occurrence of galaxy collisions: after two (spiral) galaxies smash into each other, the gas, dust and stars are mixed together and stripped off their spiral shape to finally clump into a featureless and more or less elliptical agglomeration. Their distances are relatively small, at a scale of 1:25 with respect to their size. This means that the Milky Way Galaxy being about 100,000 light years across, typical distances to other galaxies are 2.5 million light years. A huge distance, but relatively close in astronomical scales. Like stars, galaxies can be found in clusters, but astronomers surveying the universe are finding that these clusters are not evenly distributed over space. Instead, they build a large scale structure of the universe, with large ""filaments"" made of millions of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. The formation of this structure from a smooth distribution of matter at early stages of the universe is being studied and simulated with computers by astronomers. Videos and stills of these simulations can be found at: Formation of the large-scale structure in the Universe: filaments from the University of Chicago. The Known Universe Scientifically Rendered For All to See is a breathtaking video with the whole known universe has been made by the American Natural History Museum. Everything in it is based in real data, it is not a filmmaker's rendering of what is imagined out there: every object in the sequence has been detected and catalogued by astronomers.",Cosmic Voyage,98,B000060MWT

USING ""DEPARTURES"" IN THE ELA CLASSROOM The movie is uplifting but there are sad moments and viewers will cry. Have a box of tissues available and refer to it in your introduction to the film. INTRODUCING THE MOVIE The introductory comments set out below will enrich students' experience of watching the film. There is a scene in the film showing salmon swimming upstream to spawn. Salmon are born in fresh water streams but spend most of their lives in the ocean. Every year salmon return to the stream in which they were born, spawn, and then die, turning gray or white in the process. It is not an unusual site to see salmon vigorously swimming up-stream while the corpses of salmon who have already spawned and are now dead float downstream in the current. In another scene the characters eat Puffer Roe. This is a delicacy in Japan and if it is not prepared properly it contains a deadly poison. Many people have died from eating improperly prepared Puffer Roe. There is a tradition in Japan of people using public baths. This started in the time when they did not have showers in their homes. The role of shame is very strong in Japanese culture, in fact, it is said to be its main source of social control. This movie shows some sad times. Many people, including men, feel strong emotions and their eyes tear up when they watch this film. Feel free to take a tissue if you need it. Never apologize for tears. Crying is a sign of a strong and open heart, especially in men. End of suggested introductory comments. Once the students are aware of the concept of The Hero?s Journey and its accompanying archetypes, see student handout Stages and Archetypes of the Hero?s Journey — Introducing the Monomyth, they can apply the various stages of the journey to the pattern of internal growth that is experienced by the protagonist in ""Departures"" Distribute the Worksheet on The Hero?s Journey. Tell students that while the film does not contain all aspects of the classic Hero's Journey, most of the elements are clearly present and several of the archetypes appear in the story. Instruct students to make brief notes while they are watching the film and that they will be given an opportunity to complete the worksheet after the film is over. Either before or after students have completed their worksheets, hold a class discussion on the stages of the Hero's Journey and its archetypes shown in the film. NOTES ON RESPONSES TO WORKSHEET PROMPTS FOR ""DEPARTURES"" The notes below will assist teachers in leading class discussions and evaluating written responses to the discussion prompts. Most questions on the worksheet have no single correct answer. An acceptable response will be any answer which is supported by facts and reveals that the student is thinking about the story. I. Write a short one paragraph description of the quest described in this story. Daigo's journey is to find closure for the feelings of loss and abandonment that he suffered when his father deserted the family. Daigo moves from trying to please his father in the same way that he did as a child, by trying to excel at the instrument that his father wanted him to play, to feelings of loss and of anger at his father for having abandoned Daigo and his mother, and finally to acceptance and closure, allowing Daigo to lovingly prepare his father's body for cremation. II. For each stage of the Hero's Journey describe the action of the film, if any, which manifests that stage. Be specific about the stage and the corresponding actions. 1. The Ordinary World — Daigo's father had wanted his son to play the cello. When his father left home, Daigo could have rejected the memory of this father and stopped playing the instrument. Instead, Daigo buried his feelings of anger and tried to please his father by continuing to play; the child hoped that if his father returned, his father would be pleased that his son excelled at the instrument. As the movie opens, Daigo?s ordinary world is one in which even as an adult, he has suppressed his feelings of anger and is still playing the cello, trying to please his father. Daigo does his best at the cello and goes so far as to secretly buys a very expensive instrument to maximize his chances of pleasing his father. 2. The Call to Adventure — Daigo is called to his adventure involuntarily, when he realizes that despite his expensive cello, his talents are moderate and that he'll not be able to find another job in an orchestra. When Daigo decides that he can no longer make a living as a cellist, he must let go of his childish hopes and find a new way to relate to his father. Daigo's feelings of anger toward his father start to emerge. Daigo's effort to find a new way to relate to his father is the Hero's Journey in this story. 3. Refusal of the Call — Usually, Refusal of the Call comes right after the Call to Adventure but in this movie, the refusal comes late in the story. It occurs when Daigo is first informed that his father has died and, initially, refuses the entreaties of his wife and the secretary at the agency to go to the village where his father has died to view the corpse and perhaps come to reconciliation. When this is proposed, Daigo runs out of the office and down the street. 4. Meeting with the Mentor — Shoei Sadask, Daigo?s boss, teaches him respect for life and death in the process of encoffinment. The meeting with the mentor occurs when Daigo interviews for the job. 5. Crossing the First Threshold — Daigo?s first threshold is the job tending to an old woman whose body had not been discovered for two weeks. After working with the body, vomiting in the process, Daigo bathes and has clearly passed through a threshold. It is not apparent until later, why he would agree to continue with the job. The money is one reason. Certainly by the time that he goes to the first full enconfinment, the ceremony for Naomi, he feels the positive power of encoffinment. Perhaps he senses what it will mean to him in his own life. 6. Tests, Allies and Enemies — Daigo is tested several times, most dramatically when his wife tells him that she will leave him if he does not quit the job. Allies are found several places in Daigo?s experience. The secretary is an ally, as is the woman who runs the bath house, Tsuyako. A significant enemy is Daigo?s boyhood friend who tells Daigo that he should quit that repulsive job. 7. Approach to the Inmost Cave — The approach to the inmost cave occurs when Daigo finds himself at the side of his father's corpse. 8. Ordeal — Daigo?s ordeal occurs when the undertakers start to put his father in a coffin without the proper and respectful ceremony. Daigo's quest is an internal one and the crisis is in coming to resolution with his feelings for his father. These are exemplified in making the decision to care for his father's body in a loving manner. 9. Reward — Daigo?s reward is the freedom from the anger and pain associated with memories of his father. His reward is made manifest in the ""stone letter"" Daigo finds in the death-clenched fist. Daigo felt both forgiveness and love and giving the stone to his pregnant wife. 10. The Road Back: — There Road Back for Daigo is in performing the ceremony on his father's body. Since his quest was for personal growth, he does not need to return to his former Ordinary World. He is now living in a new world of emotional maturity. 11. Resurrection — Daigo is reborn when in the process of tending to his father?s body he begins to see the man?s face from long ago when father and son were together on a beach and they had exchanged stone letters. The face comes clear to Daigo, thus suggesting that the pain associated with his memories of his father has eased. 12. Returned home with the Elixir —The Elixir, the awareness of the value of sending the dead on their way with dignity and beauty, is passed to Diego?s wife and to the viewers of the film.",,"MOVIE LESSON PLAN FOR: Departures — Teaching the Hero's Journey of Internal Growth Using a Foreign Film SUBJECTS — World/Other Cultures: Japan; Literature/the Hero's Journey; SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL LEARNING — Grieving; Families in Crisis; MORAL-ETHICAL EMPHASIS — Caring. Age: 14+; MPAA Rating: PG-13 for thematic material; 2008 ; Drama; 130 Minutes; Color; Available from Amazon.com. The Japanese name for the film is ""Okuburito."" Daigo's father abandoned the family when Daigo was only six. The story of Daigo's journey to resolve his feelings about his father fits the paradigm of ""the Hero?s Journey"", also called ""the Monomyth"", a concept based on the discoveries of Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell. The stages and archetypes of the Journey are summarized in TWM's Stages and Archetypes of the Hero?s Journey — Introducing the Monomyth. TWM has also created a Hero?s Journey Worksheet to help students identify the stages and archetypes in any story in which the protagonist successfully completes an important quest. This Lesson Plan provides notes on responses when the worksheet is applied to Daigo's journey in ""Departures."" The Lesson Plan also contains suggested assignments. LESSON PLAN This lesson can be used to: (1) confirm and extend students' prior knowledge of the Hero's Journey or (2) serve as a summative assessment. Ages:          14+ Length:       The film is 130 minutes. The amount of class time needed will depend upon the length of class discussions, the number of assignments, and how many of those assignments are given as homework. TWM estimates that the lesson will take at least five 45 to 55 minute class periods. Learner Outcomes/Objectives:     Students will describe the stages and archetypes of the Hero's Journey manifested in a foreign film describing a quest for personal growth. In addition, by completing one or more of the suggested assignments students will employ and perfect the writing skills required by ELA curriculum standards. Students will be exposed to a compelling film made in a country which has customs that are different from their own. Rationale:     Stories told on screens are the literature of today's youth. Students will have an extra quantum of interest in applying the concept of the Hero's Journey and performing related ELA assignments with respect to a profoundly moving film. The Monomyth is a basic paradigm of human experience that is frequently used in written stories, drama, and film. Viewing stories involving a successful and important quest in different contexts will expand and deepen students' understanding of the role of the Hero's Journey in fiction and in life. By understanding the elements of the Journey, students will be better prepared to identify protagonist, antagonist, conflict, theme, and symbol. Introducing students to the customs of other cultures and allowing them to identify with the characters in a foreign film will increase students' empathy for persons from other countries. Description of the Film:     In this beautiful film Daigo, a young married man, is a moderately talented cellist working in a classical orchestra. Daigo's mother has died. His father abandoned the family when Daigo was six, leaving only a stone message, vague memories, and tremendous feelings of loss and anger. Daigo had started playing the cello as a young boy at his father's request. As the movie opens, the orchestra goes out of business and Daigo realizes that he is not talented enough to find work again as a cellist. He sells his cello and moves with his wife back to his home town to live in the house in which he was raised. It was from this house that his father departed when he left the family.

Rationale:     A spectacular sequence from the movie Daylight and two YouTube segments provide an effective starting point to introduce or review oxidation-reduction reactions in chemistry and to help students to relate theory learned in class to real life, including fire safety recommendations. Description of the Film Clip:    A car being chased by the police drives into a tunnel from New York to New Jersey. As the speeds through the tunnel, weaving in and out between the other cars, it finally crashes and ends up flying into a truck loaded with flammable materials. The snippet shows how the subsequent explosion sets off a shock wave of flames through the entire tunnel. One YouTube segment shows a shock wave when a rocket fuel plant explodes. The other shows an example of spontaneous combustion of a large pile of hay. Helpful Background:     Explosions, like the one shown in Daylight and many other movies, are nothing more than oxidation-reduction reactions which happen very rapidly. Slower oxidation-reduction reactions are all around us, like the rusting of some metals or a bitten apple getting brown if left in the air. For an example, see The Oxidation of an Apple. The basis of oxidation-reduction (in short: ""redox"") reactions is the transfer of electrons between atoms. The atoms losing electrons are being oxidized while those receiving electrons are being reduced. See more on rusting and its chemical reactions in What is Rust? from chemicalformulas.org. The name oxidation comes from the fact that forming a bond with oxygen is equivalent to losing electrons to the oxygen atoms, because oxygen is very electronegative. This means that oxygen exerts a strong attraction over the electrons of other atoms and basically attaches them to itself, thus gaining negative charges (it becomes a negative ion). This process leaves the other atom positively charged (as a positive ion). The charge difference is then the basis for an electrostatic attraction between both, known as ionic bonding. Recall that in the other type of bonding between atoms, covalent bonding, both atoms involved have a similar tendency to attract electrons (they both have electronegativity) and end up sharing electrons. This is a much stronger bond than the ionic bonding of redox reactions. See Figure 1. So, the term oxidation can refer to the bonding with oxygen or the loss of electrons. These are two different ways to describe the same process. There is a third meaning of the term oxidation, which is the loss of whole hydrogen atoms by a molecule. This is related to both previous meanings in that oxidizing agents remove hydrogen atoms from (generally organic) compounds when they are available. See a summary of what ""oxidation"" can mean in Definitions of Oxidation and Redox. Scientists have devised a way to unify all three meanings in one, defined as ""the increase in oxidation number."" This also explains the origin of the word reduction, as it then means ""reducing the oxidation number."" For a detailed explanation of oxidation numbers see Oxidation Numbers (Oxidation States) . Let us now review the oxidation reactions in terms of their speed and release of heat and light. Old paper becoming yellow, or potatoes and apples becoming brown, do not release either. In the rusting of iron, however, it is known that heat is released very slowly. It is not noticeable, but it can be measured. See more in Why do Apple Slices Turn Brown After Being Cut? from Scientific American and Why do Newspapers Turn Yellow Over Time? from howstuffworks.org. The next step up in oxidation is combustion. A steady release of heat and light is produced. A frequent example is organic compounds made of carbon and hydrogen that are oxidized by gaseous oxygen. This is the case of fossil fuels in their different forms used to power engines, or provide heat in fires or kitchens. Combustion can happen to gases, liquids and solids. A particular case is the combustion of metals, which release light of different colors and is used in fireworks. See Chemistry of Firework Colors from About.com for a more detailed explanation on the chemistry of firework colors. Combustion needs the fuel to reach a certain temperature in order to start. When this temperature is very low for a particular material, it can happen that it ignites spontaneously. See Spontaneous Combustion and Hay Fires, Spontaneous Combustion from makebiodiesel.org, and Pistachio nuts (for the surprising case of Pistachio nuts). A detailed explanation of why moisture is responsible for the heating up of a stack of hay can be found in Causes and Prevention of Spontaneous Combustion of Hay by Lester R. Vough, University of Maryland. What happens in the clip from Daylight is more violent still: what we know as an explosion is a very rapid, practically instantaneous oxidation, with intense heat and light release, plus an increased pressure due to rapid release of gases (products of the redox reaction). This makes a loud noise and creates a shock wave. If this shock wave is subsonic what really drives the propagation of the fire in the explosive blast is the rapid heat transfer to the materials above the temperature they need to ignite. This is called a deflagration. When the shock wave is supersonic, the high overpressures that are created when it heats materials above their autoignition temperature (kindling point) drives the explosion. This is called detonation and is the most violent oxidation mechanism. See more on explosions, detonations and deflagrations in Deflagrations vs. Detonations by John D. DeHaan, California Institute of Criminalistics, Department of Justice, State of California or Explosions, Deflagrations & Detonations. Advice on how to deal with a person in flames: As seen in the final sequence of the segment, a person who is in flames can be helped by making them roll on the floor and by wrapping them in a blanket or anything that can stop oxygen from feeding the flame. Usually people in this situation are in shock or panic, and they need to be helped, or even forced to let themselves be helped in this way.

Learner Outcomes/Objectives:    Students will be able see a faithful representation of a total solar eclipse showing Baily?s beads, the diamond ring effect, and the solar corona. Rationale:     The solar eclipse shown in ""Dolores Claiborne"" faithfully reproduces the correct atmospheric and light conditions as well as the phases of a total solar eclipse. While there is nothing like being outside during a total solar eclipse, this snippet will allow students to vicariously participate in part of that experience. Description of the Snippet:     Dolores Claiborne has recently discovered that her husband has been sexually abusing their 13-year-old daughter. She decides to murder the man by tricking him into falling down an old well-shaft while the people in the town are celebrating a total solar eclipse. The segment shows the man failing in his efforts to grab on to anything that will keep him from falling to his death. As the husband falls to his death, the Sun emerges from behind the Moon and a new day dawns for Dolores Claiborne. The segment ends with Dolores? voice-over, addressing her daughter many years after the murder. Helpful Background:     Baily?s Beads and the Diamond Ring Effect:    When the Moon is about to fully interpose itself between the Earth and the solar disc, the mountainous nature of the Moon?s surface allows the Sun to shine its last rays between the mountains. This produces a series of light beads in the last seconds before the totality of the eclipse. These are called Baily?s Beads, named after their discoverer, Francis Baily. The last bright flash of light, when just one bead is visible, often creates a beautiful sight called the diamond ring effect. Totality: the Shadow of the Moon:    The path of totality is the area on the Earth?s surface from which the total eclipse can be seen. This is about 100 miles wide and about 10,000 miles long. Many people try to chase eclipses all over the world in order to experience this effect. Those who have done so confirm that it is like nothing they have ever witnessed and that seeing photographs is not like being there. Totality: the solar corona:    The most spectacular sight of all is the solar corona. The corona (crown in Latin) is a part of the Sun made up of gas that surrounds the plasma which makes up the body of the Sun. Plasma consists of positive ions and negative electrons from atoms of hydrogen gas that have become superheated and have broken apart. In daylight, the surface of the Sun outshines the corona. An eclipse is the only chance that lay people have to see the corona. The same was true of astronomers until observatories like NASA?s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (""SOHO"") were launched into space, allowing for the constant monitoring of the Sun, including the corona. The SOHO observatory is able to produce an artificial eclipse for scientists to analyze whenever such an observation is needed.",Dolores Claiborne,110,630523650X

As the movie opens Kabul has been freed from Taliban oppression and Dr. Ahmad Sarmast, the only Afghan ever to earn a doctorate in music, returns from exile in Australia. His goal is nothing less than to revive the musical traditions of Afghanistan. He also wants to re-introduce Western music. To fulfill these goals, Dr. Sarmast establishes the Afghan National Institute of Music (ANIM). Dr. Sarmast insists that some of the students come from the population of disadvantaged young people who make their living selling small items on the streets of Kabul and that as many girls as possible come to the school. This inspiring documentary recounts Dr. Sarmast's efforts. The two suggested videos from other sources set the musical context and show a concert by the ANIM orchestra on its tour of the U.S. in early 2013, after the film was completed. Helpful Background:     Afghanistan is a country in southern Asia, a little larger than Texas and inhabited by 31,000,000 people. Much of the country is very mountainous. Afghanistan is land-locked and has no outlet to the sea. The Taliban controlled the government of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 when they were ousted by a coalition assisted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The event which lead NATO to be involved was the 9/11/2001 al-Qaeda attack that destroyed the World Trade Center in New York City. The Taliban provided safe harbor and training camps for al-Qaeda. NATO was created as a vehicle to help Western European countries resist a feared Soviet invasion after WWII. The treaty that created NATO provided that an attack on one of its members was an attack on all of them. The 9/11 attack on the U.S. was interpreted as an attack on a NATO member country. A force to oust the Taliban was approved by the U.N. Security council. While the vast majority of troops sent to Afghanistan came from the U.S., other countries contributed troops as well. Countries contributing troops included NATO members from all over Europe, countries in Central and South America, Asian countries, Australia, and New Zealand. While the Taliban have been ousted from power, they have retained control of certain portions of Afghanistan and, using safe-havens in Pakistan, continue to be a threat to the current NATO backed Afghan government. In the areas that they control, the Taliban severely repress and censor all of the arts, including music. The West's foremost expert on Afghan music is Dr. John Baily, Emeritus Professor of Ethnomusicology of Goldsmiths College in London. He reports that the censorship of music by the Taliban is not repression of all music because the Taliban allow very melodic renderings of certain types of religious songs and Taliban ""chants"". The only instrument permitted is a specific type of drum only because the Koran reports that Mohammed permitted it to be played. See Censorship of Music in Afghanistan, London, April 24, 2001. The Taliban destroy all musical instruments except for this one type of drum. Censorship of music is not new and it is not limited to Afghanistan or to the Taliban. Before the Taliban, lyrics to songs were censored for their content by the communist government installed in Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. Governments of other countries, particularly dictatorships, have engaged in similar censorship. Some countries have censored types of music, fearing political or social disruption. For example, the Cuba's communist government, led by Fidel Castro, prohibited American Jazz believing that the free spirit of jazz compositions would undermine political conformity. See A Lesson Plan on Artistic Freedom As a Human Right featuring the movie For Love or Country. However, the censorship by the Taliban has been one of the most complete and brutally enforced musical censorships in recent times.

After escaping from Germany to Russian occupied Poland, Solly was placed in a Soviet orphanage where he joined the Komsomol, the Communist youth organization. When Hitler invaded Russia, Solly was captured by the German Army. In order to avoid being sent to a concentration camp, he convinced his captors that he was an ethnic German. Solly, now fluent in Russian, was used by the German Army as an interpreter. As a reward for heroism, he was sent to an exclusive school in Germany run by the Hitler Youth organization.

118,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/ever-after.html,"""Ever After"" is an enchanting re-imagining of the Cinderella fairy tale set in France during the Renaissance. In this version the little cinder girl is a well-read young woman of passionate intelligence and integrity named Danielle. She awakens a jaded prince of France by advocating concepts from Sir Thomas More's Utopia. The Prince, it turns out, is suffocating in the gilded cage of royal life. In a charming departure from the plot of the classic tale, the cinder girl saves the Prince just as much as he saves her. Leonardo da Vinci, who served as artist in residence at the French court from 1516 to 1519, acts out the role of fairy godmother. The Mona Lisa and several of his famous inventions make cameo appearances. This is a very literate tale, told with great wit and charm. Benefits of the Movie: This movie is an effortlessly feminist take on a beloved story. Danielle is a wonderful role model for any young woman: intellectually vibrant, loyal, courageous, and tender-hearted. Students can move from ""Ever After"" to a study of the original Cinderella, and the role of fairy and folk tales in helping children deal with the developmental issues involved in growing up, leaving home, meeting the world's challenges, and reaching authentic maturity. See Fairy Tales: A Vital Literary Genre for Children ""Ever After"" also introduces children to the new world of social thought that was dawning in Europe during the Renaissance. See The Renaissance. The genius of Leonardo is highlighted in a lighthearted manner as his character wanders into the action from the periphery and then champions the match of Danielle and the Prince. Leonardo tries to walk on water in his boat shoes, agrees to critique the work of a young painter, and mentions that Michelangelo is stuck under a ceiling in Rome (the Sistine Chapel). Danielle flies a kite of Leonardo's design. See section of this Guide on Leonardo. Possible Problems:     MINIMAL. There are a number of historical errors in the film. These can be turned into teaching opportunities, see Teaching from Historical Errors. Suggested Lesson Plan:     Start with the Introduction and the Time Line. After the movie is finished, give the class a lecture presenting the information in the Helpful Background Section. You can also pause the movie to discuss some of the background information. When the movie and the lecture are finished, organize a class discussion around the Quick Discussion Question, the curriculum related discussion questions and Teaching from Historical Errors.

Discuss the correct answers and those incorrect answers that have blue italicized comments. See Answer Key and Comments to Comprehension Test. This lesson plan, including the movie, should take about five or six 55 minute class periods. Teachers will adapt the elements discussed above to the needs of their classes. Additional teaching resources can be found in Classroom Projects, Social-Emotional Learning Discussion Questions, and Moral-Ethical Emphasis Discussion Questions.

The benefits will increase dramatically if you go through the Helpful Background section with your child. After the movie, ask how the film was different from the classic Cinderella tale.

A woman makes a pass at Professor Groeteschele, the villain of the film. He slaps her. The film begins with a dream sequence showing the agony of a bull being killed in a bullfight. While this sequence adds a layer of meaning to the film, it is not essential. Children who are sensitive and who are empathic towards animals should be warned and perhaps they should skip the first 60 seconds of the film (until the end of the dream sequence). One of the characters, under extreme provocation, commits suicide. There is mild profanity in the movie. The words ""damn"" and ""hell"" are used several times. The dramatic tension in ""Fail-Safe"" builds slowly through the first 25 minutes. It may be necessary to remind children during this time that the drama will become intense as the film unfolds its gripping tale. Some critics claim that the fears of accidental nuclear war are exaggerated and that the fail-safe system shown in the movie is much different than those actually employed by the United States. See compendium of critiques and defenses of the film at StrategyPage.com. The points of the critics are important and should be discussed with children who see the film.

The film is an excellent way to introduce or complete a discussion of this topic in conjunction with TeachWithMovies' Lesson Plan on Mass Casualties and Making Decisions About War which includes an in-depth analysis of the decision to end WWII with atomic bomb attacks on Japan. This movie shows how the United States assembled the manpower and created the organization to use forces inside the atom as a weapon. It shows men working together as a team, resolving their differences, and achieving success through the use of intelligence, goodwill towards each other, and commitment to a common goal. The Manhattan Project is another demonstration that one of the reasons the Allies won the Second World War was the ability to successfully manage complex organizations. Because ""Fat Man and Little Boy"" focuses on the development of both the implosion and explosion models for triggering a nuclear chain reaction, the movie can supplement lessons about fission, fusion, supercritical mass, chain reaction, and other aspects of subatomic physics.

The film is an excellent way to introduce or complete a discussion of this topic in conjunction with TeachWithMovies' Lesson Plan on Mass Casualties and Making Decisions About War which includes an in-depth analysis of the decision to end WWII with atomic bomb attacks on Japan. This movie shows how the United States assembled the manpower and created the organization to use forces inside the atom as a weapon. It shows men working together as a team, resolving their differences, and achieving success through the use of intelligence, goodwill towards each other, and commitment to a common goal. The Manhattan Project is another demonstration that one of the reasons the Allies won the Second World War was the ability to successfully manage complex organizations. Because ""Fat Man and Little Boy"" focuses on the development of both the implosion and explosion models for triggering a nuclear chain reaction, the movie can supplement lessons about fission, fusion, supercritical mass, chain reaction, and other aspects of subatomic physics. The film briefly introduces important scientists, such as Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, and Robert Wilson. The movie also explores the sometimes tense partnership between the military and the scientific community as they dealt with the extreme pressure of building a nuclear bomb on a tight schedule.",Fat Man and Little Boy,124,B0001EQIJC

One of the Jewish villagers, Tevye, has personal conversations with God but otherwise lives according to the traditions of his people.

It is also a beautiful musical, possessing a compelling story line, enchanting music, excellent cinematography, and stunning choreography. This movie includes popular songs such as ""Tradition,"" ""Matchmaker, Matchmaker,"" ""To Life,"" ""Miracle of Miracles,"" ""Sunrise, Sunset"" and ""If I Were a Rich Man.""","MODERATE. Tevye's decision to reject Chava might make some children nervous about possible rejection by their own parents and send the wrong message about parenting. When showing this movie to young children parents should remark on the fact that Tevye's decision to reject Chava for marrying a Christian was wrong because it placed tradition, prejudice, and religion before a parent's love for a child. When showing this movie to older children ask the Quick Discussion Question and make sure that children understand the answer. There are many stereotypes of Jewish characters but they are all lovingly portrayed. There is one scene in which Tevye, Lazar Wolf and the other male villagers get roaring drunk and have a good time. Parenting Points:     For younger children this musical is all about the music and the dancing. For children 10 - 12, just point out how Tevye departed from tradition in allowing his first two daughters to marry the men they loved. For older children ask and help them to answer the Quick Discussion Question. Other good discussion questions for parents to review with their children are #s 5 and 8.

124,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/film-study-worksheet.html,,,,,,"FILM STUDY WORKSHEET FOR A WORK OF FICTION — GENERAL (Movie Worksheet) Designed to get students thinking about movies as stories that employ the elements and devices of fiction, this movie worksheet can be used for note-taking during breaks while watching a film. After the movie has been completed, responses to the worksheet prompts can be written up as paragraphs or short essays, perhaps as homework the evening after the movie is shown. TWM's Film Study Worksheet will help students: determine theme; analyze plot and its various phases; examine how literary elements affect plot progression, assist in character development, and convey meaning, including: motif, symbol, foreshadowing, echoing, flashback, opposition, metaphor, irony, foil, choice of language; and organize their thoughts. Movie worksheets allow teachers who show films to meet the Common Core State Standards. See TWM's article on Common Core State Standards and Feature Films in the ELA Classroom. Click here for the Film Study Worksheet for General Fiction (this worksheet) in word processing format suitable to be downloaded and printed or modified. TWM also features other movie worksheets, including worksheets for: Adaptations of Novels; The Hero's Journey; Historical Fiction; Science Fiction; and Documentaries. INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE WORKSHEET The movie worksheet is designed to be copied onto the front and back of one sheet of paper. It can faciliate class discussions or be the basis for writing assignments. Add, modify or substitute questions as appropriate for the class. For example, if students will not recognize any of the devices of fiction described in Question #11, delete them. If students have previously received instruction in devices of fiction that are not mentioned in the question, add them. The Film Study Worksheet is an excellent opportunity to review past learning. The same is true for question #12, relating to the elements of the cinematic art. If students are not familiar with any of the techniques described in the question, delete them and, perhaps, delete the question entirely. If students have previously received instruction in other techniques of film, add them to the question. If archetypes appear in the film and students have received instruction in archetypes, consider using TWM's Film Study Worksheet for the Hero's Journey or adding questions from that worksheet. If you use the worksheet more than twice, vary it somewhat by changing the questions, making sure that the new questions ask students to describe or comment on elements or devices of fiction found in the movie. TWM suggests that movie worksheets do more than just require students to restate what occurred in the film. In most cases have the class read the questions on the worksheet before watching the movie. Provide several short three to five minute breaks while showing the film to allow students to take notes. Discourage the class from taking notes while the movie is running. Allow time at the film's end for students to complete their notes. If necessary, remind students that the antagonist in a story is not necessarily a person. It can also be nature, an institution, a condition of society, a personality trait of the protagonist, or a problem in the relationship between the protagonist and another person. The antagonist is whoever or whatever the protagonist must overcome in the conflict described in the story. A sample set of instructions is set out below. These can be changed as necessary. Read the questions before you watch the film so that you will know what to look for while you watch. At breaks during the showing or at the film's end, you will have an opportunity to make short notes in the spaces provided. If you make notes while the film is playing, make sure that your note taking doesn't interfere with carefully watching the film. You do not need to make any notes on the worksheet but after the film is over you will be required to fully respond to the questions. Complete the assignment by answering each question in paragraph form. Answers need to be complete and comprehensive, demonstrating that you paid attention to the film and thought about what was shown on the screen. You may use more than one paragraph if necessary. Be sure that the topic sentence of your first paragraph uses key words from the question. All responses should be in complete sentences using proper spelling, grammar and punctuation. There are many different ways that the Worksheet can be employed in class. For example, instead of having each student provide a written response to the Worksheet, the questions can serve as the basis for a class discussion. Students can also be separated into groups of four or fewer, with each group being asked to give an oral presentation in response to a question on the Worksheet. For middle school or junior high school classes, the Worksheet can be simplified by eliminating some of the questions or by only requiring a single device of fiction to be discussed (Question #11) and by reducing the number of themes to be derived from the film (Question #10). ADVERTISEMENT ADVANTAGES OF USING GENERIC FILM STUDY WORKSHEETS RATHER THAN ONLY ASKING STUDENTS TO RECALL EVENTS AND PLOT DETAILS Some movie worksheets contain questions about random scenes in the movie to test whether students have been paying attention. This ensures that students follow the movie and don't daydream or do homework. Using this type of worksheet is clearly beneficial when the film has educational value or is going to be used to drive assignments requiring the exercise of important skills. It's certainly much better than simply putting the DVD in the player and letting the movie run. However, much more can be done with film study worksheets than merely ensuring that students are paying attention. Skillfully written worksheets require students to perform a literary analysis of the film's story and point students to lessons that teachers want them to learn. Such worksheets stress the literary elements and devices of fiction traditionally taught in ELA classes. In fact, there is no need to ask any specific questions about occurrences in the movie. General questions about plot, theme, characters, imagery, symbol, etc. keep students focused and require that they know the details of the film. Moreover, when a movie worksheet requires students to perform a literary analysis, it will impress upon students the fact that movies contain stories which are similar to those found in written texts. A movie worksheet designed in this manner requires students to use thinking skills of a higher level than those required to simply remember and regurgitate incidents in the film. For this reason, TWM Learning Guides suggest movie worksheets that are specific to the film only in special circumstances. TWM has developed generic movie worksheets designed to cover most types of fictional presentations. These worksheets stress the literary elements and devices of the story and engage higher level thinking skills. There are worksheets for: General Fiction (this worksheet); Adaptations of Novels; The Hero's Journey; Historical Fiction; and Science Fiction. These movie worksheets are designed to be modified for the abilities of the class, the curriculum goals of the teacher, the idiosyncrasies of the film, and specific literary, dramatic, or cinematic elements that the class has studied that may be evident from the movie. Movie worksheets that require literary analysis and higher order thinking, rather than just the recollection of isolated facts, make better use of the valuable class time spent in watching a movie. It is for this reason that TWM suggests that teachers use generic film study worksheets. Revised on April 21, 2013. Written by James Frieden, TWM.

Age: 15+; MPAA Rating -- R for sequences of graphic war violence and carnage, and for language; Drama; 2006, 135 minutes; Color. Available from Amazon.com. Description: This is the story of six Marines photographed while raising a U.S. flag during the WWII battle for Iwo Jima. The photograph evoked strong emotions in the American public and to this day serves as an iconic image of U.S. soldiers in combat. Only three of the flag raisers survived the carnage on Iwo Jima. They were ordered home to serve as the major attraction for a national campaign to sell war bonds. As the three Marines toured the country, they were idolized as heroes. However, for them, the act of raising the flag was not heroic at all. There was no enemy resistance at that location and the flag was merely a replacement for the first U.S. flag flown over the island. The effort shown in the photograph was the struggle to lift a heavy metal flag-pole, not to defeat an enemy. To the flag raisers, the adulation they received was undeserved and the real heroes were their 6800 fellow Marines who died in the battle. The movie explores the experiences of the six flag raisers in battle on Iwo Jima and the lives of the three who survived the fighting . . . lives played out in the shadow of ""the Photograph."" Rationale for Using the Movie: Flags of Our Fathers provides vivid images of the battle of Iwo Jima and the massive bond drives used by the government to finance WWII. It is also an excellent platform for exploring: (A) the nature of heroism and the difference between heroism and celebrity; (B) the disconnect between what actually happened, which is often very complex, and the historical interpretation of events, which often simplifies what occurred; and (C) the creation of patriotic symbols and how they become important for what people read into them rather than as accurate representations of past events.

129,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/force-more-powerful.html,"This documentary chronicles the rise of nonviolent direct action by large numbers of people as a force for political and social change. The movie provides six examples in which nonviolent direct action changed the history of the 20th century. A Force More Powerful can serve as the basis for a two or three week unit exploring nonviolent direct action as a force for political and social change. The movie comes in six separate sections. Teachers can select the sections that would provide the most assistance in their classes. For example, the first two sections, dealing with the Nashville sit-ins and the movement seeking independence in India, are an excellent supplement to a unit on the U.S. Civil Rights Movement or for a class in government/civics. The sections on the Indian independence movement, Solidarity's challenge to Poland's communist government, and the defeat of Pinochet in Chile are an excellent capstone for a contemporary World History class.",,"This documentary graphically demonstrates that as war has become more violent and the means of communication more effective, people have adapted by developing a new political force of immense power: nonviolent direct action (also called ""civil disobedience,"" and ""non-violent resistance"" or ""civil resistance""). This film shows the modern origins of the new political/social force by Mohandas K. Gandhi in South Africa and India. It describes other examples of nonviolent direct action at work. Nonviolent direct action continues to be a major source of progressive political and social change throughout the world. TeachWithMovies.com believes that no student will have a good grasp of world or U.S. history without an understanding of this new tactic for social and political change. A Force More Powerful provides its own historical background. Our independent research has confirmed many of the historical facts presented by the movie. This Learning Guide will provide additional interesting background on the situations featured in the film. The story of the Nashville sit-ins and Mr. James Lawson is particularly relevant to U.S. students. See We Were Warriors -- Nashville 1960. Another important benefit of the film is that at least two of the major actors were relatively young when they served as leaders of nonviolent direct action campaigns. James Lawson was 30 years old and Mkhuseli Jack an activist in South Africa was 27. Note: There is a very helpful website from the filmmakers with three lesson plans and other resources. The TWM Learning Guide to A Force More Powerful has been designed to supplement the lesson plans on the filmmakers' website. For example, the filmmakers do not provide suggested answers to their proposed discussion questions. This Learning Guide recasts those discussion questions, supplements them, and provides suggested answers. The Historical Background contained in this Learning Guide does not duplicate the background provided by the movie or the filmmakers on their website, but adds important and interesting facts. For example, in Chile, Augusto Pinochet did not simply disappear after his defeat in the plebiscite described in the film. The section of this Learning Guide on Chile describes the extent to which Pinochet, the Chilean right wing, and the Chilean military continued to be a major force in Chile's governance for decades after losing the election.",None.,,"LEARNING GUIDE TO: A Force More Powerful One of the Best! This movie is on TWM's short list of the best movies to supplement classes in United States History, High School Level. SUBJECTS — World/India, Poland, Denmark, Chile, South Africa; 1800s - the;         Present; Civics/Government; U.S./1945 the Present; Civil Rights Movement, Tennessee; SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL LEARNING — Peace/Peacemakers; MORAL-ETHICAL EMPHASIS — Citizenship. Age: 12+; No MPAA Rating; Documentary; 1999; length: six sections each between 20 and 30 minutes in length; Color; Available from the filmmakers directly. Description:     This documentary chronicles the rise of nonviolent direct action by large numbers of people as a force for political and social change. The movie provides six examples in which nonviolent direct action changed the history of the 20th century. A Force More Powerful can serve as the basis for a two or three week unit exploring nonviolent direct action as a force for political and social change. The movie comes in six separate sections. Teachers can select the sections that would provide the most assistance in their classes. For example, the first two sections, dealing with the Nashville sit-ins and the movement seeking independence in India, are an excellent supplement to a unit on the U.S. Civil Rights Movement or for a class in government/civics. The sections on the Indian independence movement, Solidarity's challenge to Poland's communist government, and the defeat of Pinochet in Chile are an excellent capstone for a contemporary World History class. Benefits of the Movie:     This documentary graphically demonstrates that as war has become more violent and the means of communication more effective, people have adapted by developing a new political force of immense power: nonviolent direct action (also called ""civil disobedience,"" and ""non-violent resistance"" or ""civil resistance""). This film shows the modern origins of the new political/social force by Mohandas K. Gandhi in South Africa and India. It describes other examples of nonviolent direct action at work. Nonviolent direct action continues to be a major source of progressive political and social change throughout the world. TeachWithMovies.com believes that no student will have a good grasp of world or U.S. history without an understanding of this new tactic for social and political change. A Force More Powerful provides its own historical background. Our independent research has confirmed many of the historical facts presented by the movie. This Learning Guide will provide additional interesting background on the situations featured in the film.

First, tell your kids that this is the story of us, of the people who are not powerful, acting together to change history. Second, these five examples are just the tip of the iceberg. Nonviolent direct action brought down the Soviet Union which was then a superpower that rivaled the United States. The people of many countries around the world have used nonviolent direct action to remove repressive regimes. In addition, nonviolent direct action was the major new political development of the 20th century.

The first two stories are accurate and the accuracy of the third is none of our business.,,"""For Love or Country"" introduces the problems of artists in totalitarian countries, Fidel Castro's betrayal of the promise of the Cuban revolution, and the jazz music of Dizzy Gillespie and Arturo Sandoval. Note that the story begins during the opening credits. This film can be shown with only a short discussion period on the human rights of artists and correction for the problem discussed below, or it can serve as the basis for a week-long lesson plan demonstrating the importance of artistic freedom as a human right. This Learning Guide includes all that is necessary for the week-long unit. Teachers should pick and choose which elements of the Guide are appropriate for their particular classes. Lesson Plan on Artistic Freedom as a Human Right. 1.  Preparation Before Viewing the Film: TWM has provided a brief introduction to the differences between Communism, socialism, and capitalism, Cuba and its revolution, jazz, and Dizzy Gillespie. See Background for the Film ""For Love or Country"" TWM recommends that the Background be assigned as homework or that the teacher review the concepts with the class. TWM has prepared a copy of the Background in Microsoft® Word® format. The Background includes more materials than many teachers will want to use. Users should feel free to delete those sections which they feel are not necessary or add additional information that they wish their class to read. For those classes with students who will not be able to absorb the information from reading the Background, review it through class discussion. Attach a copy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the materials distributed to the class. Instruct students to bring their copy of the Declaration to all classes relating to this unit, including the class at which the test will be given. 2. Watching the Movie: Before showing the film, teachers should tell their classes that they don't know whether the portions of the film relating to the romance between Mr. Sandoval and Marianela are accurate. Students should also be told that they will see a character called the ""the embassy interviewer"" who is an amalgam of several people and a fictional device to allow the Sandoval character to tell his story. However, with respect to just about everything else, the film can be relied upon to present a reasonably accurate portrayal of what happened to Mr. Sandoval and what he did about it. Teachers should indicate that more will be revealed to the students after they see the film. 3. Class Discussion After the Film: TWM has also prepared Lecture Notes which contain suggestions for a class discussion about the accuracy of the movie and human rights as applied to artists. The class discussion also corrects for the problems with the film based upon the romantic story line. See Possible Problems section below. The lecture materials prepare students for some of the more challenging questions in the comprehension test/homework assignment. 4. Comprehension Test/Homework Assignment: TeachWithMovies has prepared a comprehension test which will further enhance learning on the topics presented in the lesson plan and which will assess students' understanding of the human rights of artists. In the alternative, students can be requested to write short essays on some of the test questions or on some of the discussion questions set out below. Possible Problems:     MODERATE: People swear a few times when they are angry. Mr. Sandoval and his wife-to-be are portrayed as sleeping together on the first day that they meet. We have no idea if this actually happened but it is risky behavior, for both physical and emotional health. It is also considered to be unethical by most religions and ethical systems. Adults who view this film with children should comment on this and explain why movie makers are so partial to quick romances. See Social-Emotional Learning Discussion Questions with answers. Parenting Points:     Before showing this film tell your child that, except for the love story, this movie accurately recounts what occurred. (We don't know about the love story.) Ask and help your child to answer the Quick Discussion Question. Get a CD of Dizzy Gillespie or Arturo Sandoval and play it around the house. Tell your child what you are playing.

TWM Advises Against Being Drawn Into a Debate About the Factual Accuracy of the Movie's Description of Mr. Grant's Last Day: The legal system has found that this young man's life was criminally and tragically cut short. A discussion about whether Mr. Grant was a loving father and boyfriend who was trying to put his mistakes behind him, as described in the movie, would detract from any lessons to be drawn from the film. TWM does not have the resources to determine if the film's portrayal of Mr. Grant was, overall, accurate and we assume that it was.

Parenting Points:     Tell your child that this film is true in most of its facts. When the movie is over, ask and help your child answer the Quick Discussion Question. TWM highly recommends a trip to the The Gettysburg National Military Park. Because so many men died there, because the battlefield is full of memorials, and because the Battle of Gettysburg saw the high water mark of the rebellion, a visit to Gettysburg is an emotional experience. There are memorial stones to every significant event of the battle. Look for the stone marker showing the point from which the men of Chamberlain's 20th Maine, low on ammunition, fixed their bayonets and charged down the hill to protect the Union left flank. Walk the route of Pickett's Charge, from Virginia's statue of Robert E. Lee to the crown of Cemetery Hill. Cross ""the Angle"" from which the Union soldiers riddled the Southerners with rifle fire and then retreated. Walk the small field behind ""the Angle"" at which the high water mark was reached, and where, in hand-to-hand combat, Union soldiers completed the destruction of Pickett's division. Put a flower on the memorial which marks the spot where General Armistead fell, that tortured soul who loved his friend, Hancock. There is a special energy, a special poignancy, about this place that impresses almost everyone who goes there. (If you can, visit during July 1 - 3, the anniversary dates of the battle, and attend one of the reenactments. The proceeds go to local charities.) QUICK DISCUSSION QUESTION:   Chamberlain, when he is talking to the men who refused to fight because their enlistments had expired, tells them that the Union Army is different than other armies that the world had known before. What was his point? Was he correct? What about the rebel army that served under Washington in the American Revolution or the armies of Republican France during the French Revolution? What about the Confederate Army? Suggested Response: Chamberlain meant that the army was fighting for an ideal, not for conquest. Chamberlain was historically incorrect, although not by much. We can think of several armies that fought for their ideals before the Civil War. First, the Continental Army that served under George Washington and won the American Revolution. Second, the armies that protected France from invasion by foreign nations during the French Revolution. They were fighting to prevent the reinstatement of the monarchy and for the ideals of the French Revolution. Third, the armies of former slaves that fought the French (Napoleon was Emperor of France at the time) for control of Haiti. There may have been others. However, Chamberlain's general point was well-taken. Armies that fought for ideals were relatively new at that point in history. It can also be noted that while the soldiers themselves were not fighting for personal financial gain, the South saw the war as its resistance to efforts by the financial powers of the North to dominate the economy of the South. So, in one sense, the war could be said to have been for financial gain.M",,"LEARNING GUIDE TO: GETTYSBURG SUBJECTS — U.S./1861-1865 & Pennsylvania; SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL LEARNING — Courage in War; Leadership; MORAL-ETHICAL EMPHASIS — Trustworthiness; Citizenship.

TWM highly recommends a trip to the The Gettysburg National Military Park. Because so many men died there, because the battlefield is full of memorials, and because the Battle of Gettysburg saw the high water mark of the rebellion, a visit to Gettysburg is an emotional experience. There are memorial stones to every significant event of the battle. Look for the stone marker showing the point from which the men of Chamberlain's 20th Maine, low on ammunition, fixed their bayonets and charged down the hill to protect the Union left flank. Walk the route of Pickett's Charge, from Virginia's statue of Robert E. Lee to the crown of Cemetery Hill. Cross ""the Angle"" from which the Union soldiers riddled the Southerners with rifle fire and then retreated. Walk the small field behind ""the Angle"" at which the high water mark was reached, and where, in hand-to-hand combat, Union soldiers completed the destruction of Pickett's division. Put a flower on the memorial which marks the spot where General Armistead fell, that tortured soul who loved his friend, Hancock. There is a special energy, a special poignancy, about this place that impresses almost everyone who goes there. (If you can, visit during July 1 - 3, the anniversary dates of the battle, and attend one of the reenactments. The proceeds go to local charities.) QUICK DISCUSSION QUESTION:   Chamberlain, when he is talking to the men who refused to fight because their enlistments had expired, tells them that the Union Army is different than other armies that the world had known before. What was his point? Was he correct? What about the rebel army that served under Washington in the American Revolution or the armies of Republican France during the French Revolution? What about the Confederate Army? Suggested Response: Chamberlain meant that the army was fighting for an ideal, not for conquest. Chamberlain was historically incorrect, although not by much. We can think of several armies that fought for their ideals before the Civil War. First, the Continental Army that served under George Washington and won the American Revolution. Second, the armies that protected France from invasion by foreign nations during the French Revolution. They were fighting to prevent the reinstatement of the monarchy and for the ideals of the French Revolution. Third, the armies of former slaves that fought the French (Napoleon was Emperor of France at the time) for control of Haiti. There may have been others. However, Chamberlain's general point was well-taken. Armies that fought for ideals were relatively new at that point in history. It can also be noted that while the soldiers themselves were not fighting for personal financial gain, the South saw the war as its resistance to efforts by the financial powers of the North to dominate the economy of the South. So, in one sense, the war could be said to have been for financial gain.M",Gettysburg,150,B00003CXA6

SUGGESTIONS FOR USING GLORY IN THE CLASSROOM Introducing the Movie Before showing the film, tell the class that most of the incidents portrayed in the film really happened. Pre-Viewing Enrichment Worksheet: The self-sacrifice of the soldiers of the Massachusetts 54th was made in the context of the effort of abolitionists and free blacks to get Lincoln and the Federal government to make the Civil War a war to abolish slavery. When the war began it was only to preserve the Union, as important a goal as that was. For classes that have not already studied the topic, TWM suggests that students be required to read and respond to the questions in the following enrichment worksheet. Enrichment Worksheets are a TWM innovation containing text and questions designed to get students thinking. Questions are focused on comprehension, application, analysis, syntheses, or evaluation. Questions can be answered in class or as homework, as quickwrites, journal entries, formal essays, or research papers. For a version of the Worksheet in word processing format, click here. Changing Reasons for the North's Involvement in the Civil War Abraham Lincoln was not elected President based on a promise to end slavery. In fact, it was just the opposite. He promised to leave slavery alone in the South. However, Lincoln wanted to prevent slavery from extending to any free state or any of the territories. It was this position that brought on secession. Most Union soldiers fought so that ""government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."" At the beginning of the war, abolitionists were a minority. Had the war been seen as a crusade to end slavery, most Union soldiers would not have fought. In addition, the Union desperately needed the border states of Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri. It was difficult to keep these states in the Union and would have been impossible if Lincoln had proposed ending slavery at the beginning of the war. The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on January 1, 1863, freed the slaves only in the areas of insurrection and did not affect slavery in the Border states. Question #1: In the present day and age, is preserving the United States as one country and not letting states secede from the Union, worth fighting a bloody civil war? During the War several things happened to seal the doom of slavery in the United States. Among these were the fact that the death toll for the war was incredibly high and even the goal of preserving one of the few broad-based democratic governments then existing in the world, did not justify all the bloodletting. By the end of the War, 360,000 Union soldiers had died from disease or wounds suffered in battle. Many more were injured. The death toll for the Confederate armies was about 258,000. Abolitionists like Frederick Douglass had been telling President Lincoln that the war didn't make sense if slavery was allowed to exist when the conflict was over. Second, while most Confederate soldiers were not slave owners, the power structure in the Confederacy was based on the ownership of slaves. As the war ground on, the North realized that the elimination of slavery was an efficient way to destroy the power-base of the secessionists. A third reason was the increasingly important role that black soldiers came to play in the Union Army. Authorization to enlist black soldiers was granted by Congress in July of 1862. The Massachusetts 54th, the first all black regiment began to enroll black soldiers in March of 1863. Eventually, some 179,000 black soldiers served in the Union Army (about 10% of its total strength) and another 19,000 served in the Navy (a total of 198,000 men). About 37,000 black soldiers lost their lives in the struggle; that's about one in five of those who enlisted. As more black men took on the Union uniform, the possibility of retaining slavery after the war became more and more remote. After all, when a man had risked his life for his country, who could deny him citizenship? Who could look him in the eye and argue that members of his family or he himself must be enslaved? Question #2: Should the U.S. allow legal or even illegal aliens who risk their lives in combat to become citizens? Lincoln's Second Inaugural address, delivered on March 4, 1865, is one of the most moving speeches ever given by a political leader. It was delivered when the Union Armies were ascendant and when Lee's surrender, April 9, 1865, was just over a month away. The great bulk of Union casualties, both among white soldiers and black, had occurred by this time. The President started the speech by reflecting on the time of his first inaugural address. . . . On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought to avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war — seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came. One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. ""Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh."" If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said ""the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether."" With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations. Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865, just 40 days after his second inaugural address. Question #3: Would you be willing to donate a kidney to allow another person to live?

Gradually, Fossey moved from fascinated observer to passionately aggressive conservationist, determined to protect ""her"" gorillas at all costs. Acting almost alone, she saved them from extinction. Today the mountain gorillas are still threatened by habitat destruction, but their numbers have increased. Fossey brought their plight to the attention of the entire world, making an enormous contribution to the animal protection and ecology movements.",,"""Gorillas in the Mist"" is an excellent and motivating introduction to primatology, gorillas, and Africa. The movie recreates the wonderful scene in which Fossey becomes the first human being to affectionately communicate with a mountain gorilla in the wild. The movie shows how one person protected an entire species of magnificent animals from extinction. The movie also shows the dark side of Dian Fossey, how her utter devotion to the cause of the gorillas, combined with isolation and frustration, ultimately led her to use abusive and extreme tactics. ""Gorillas in the Mist"" is an excellent study in the nature and risks of obsession. The movie can also serve to interest children in the ""trimates,"" Fossey and two other women who became identified with the study of the great apes. They are Jane Goodall, who studied the chimpanzees of Tanzania, and Birute Galdikas, less widely known, who did the same for the orangutans of Borneo. Each of these women conducted pioneering research and forged almost miraculous connections with individual animals.","SERIOUS. Fossey takes up with a married man and neither of them show any remorse. See discussion question on fidelity in this film. The movie contains scenes of Fossey and her friend hugging and kissing, in bed after making love and in a bath together. No ""objectionable"" body parts are shown, being hidden by clothing, bed clothes or water and suds. There are gory views of massacred gorillas and a scene in which Fossey psychologically tortures a child caught while accompanying his father on a poaching mission. Fossey shows no respect for others when she is provoked. After Digit, her favorite gorilla, is decapitated by poachers, Fossey subjects one to a mock hanging and burns huts in the poachers' village. She is also shown breaking into a van carrying captured animals to seize a captive baby gorilla legally purchased by a trader for a zoo in Europe. Garden variety profanity occurs on about ten occasions in the film. There are also some distortions of the historical record but the essential elements are accurately presented. See Note on Historical Accuracy in the Helpful Background Section. Parenting Points:     Allow your children to enjoy watching this sensitive and determined woman interact with gorillas and after the film is over ask them what animals they would want to work with, were able to get to know animals in the wild.

The 1974 version imposes a dated 1970?s ambience which to some extent obscures Fitzgerald?s vision.",,"LEARNING GUIDE TO: THE GREAT GATSBY SUBJECTS — U.S. 1913 - 1929 & New York; Literature; Literary Devices:         symbol, imagery, motif, flashback, characterization; SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL LEARNING — Romantic Relationships; MORAL-ETHICAL EMPHASIS — Responsibility. 1974 Version: Age: 14+; MPAA Rating: PG; Drama; 144 minutes; Color. Available from Amazon.com. 2001 Version: Age: 14+; Not Rated; Drama; 100 minutes; Color. Available from Amazon.com. NOTE TO TEACHERS: This Guide will helpful in supplementing classes in which students read the novel. All three movie versions of The Great Gatsby fall short of the novel?s splendor. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote some of the most beautiful prose in the English language, and it is on display in his book. While each film is a serviceable adaption of the novel, because of length limitations and in service of a tighter, more conventional rendition of the story, the dialogue and Nick's narration have been moved between and among scenes. The screenwriters have invented dialogue, inserted scenes and images, and created flashbacks that are not found in the book. These modifications work in both movies but inevitably take them away from the original written work. In addition, the movies cannot include most of Fitzgerald's beautifully written descriptive passages. While each film has its strengths and weaknesses, teachers should note that the 1974 version imposes a dated 1970?s ambience which to some extent obscures Fitzgerald?s vision of America in the roaring and decadent 20?s. The 2000 version contains several instances, some discussed below, in which the screenwriter enhances the impact of Fitzgerald's story by extending the symbols and imagery used in the novel. In addition, the 2000 version at 100 minutes is 44 minutes shorter than the 1974 version. The 2013 version, directed by Baz Luhrman, eliminates many important parts of the novel, including the love affair between Nick and Jordan,Nick's adoration of Daisy, and Nick's talk with Gatsby's father. The casting for the new version works, except that Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby is miscast. He simply doesn't have the body type to be Gatsby. While DiCaprio's excellent acting skills almost make up for this discrepancy, on the whole, the performance just doesn't work. Description:     James Gatz was a poor boy from the Midwest who fell in love with Daisy, a spoiled girl from a wealthy Louisville family. They met when he was a young officer waiting to be shipped to Europe for the First World War. The young man fell deeply in love with Daisy, and she, in her way, returned his love. ""Jay Gatsby,"" as he styled himself, soon departed for the fighting fields of France. Daisy didn't hear from him for long periods of time. Unable to keep the flame alive, she succumbed to the blandishments of Tom Buchanan, a man of immense wealth and little fidelity. Tom and Daisy were married while Gatsby was still overseas. Gatsby was determined to recapture the love that he and Daisy had shared. After the war he tried to remake himself into a man of sophistication and wealth, all to impress his girl. He attended a course offered to American officers at Oxford University in England and picked up some of the mannerisms of a young British aristocrat. Upon his return from Europe, in order to grow quickly rich, Gatsby turned to bootlegging and bond swindles. All of the above is background. The action begins when Gatsby rents an opulent mansion on Long Island across the bay from the mansion shared by Daisy and her husband. Daisy is unhappy because Tom is having a not-so-secret affair with the wife of a man who owns a gas station on the road from Long Island to New York City. Gatsby throws famously lavish parties, to which anyone is welcome. He half expects that Daisy will wander in one night and be impressed by his wealth and status. She never does, but then Gatsby learns that Nick, Daisy's cousin, has rented a small house next door to the Gatsby mansion. Gatsby befriends Nick, who obligingly arranges for Daisy to come for afternoon tea. By prearrangement, Gatsby just happens to drop by. There are a few awkward moments but Gatsby and Daisy reestablish their acquaintance. After a tour of Gatsby's mansion, Daisy is in love with Gatsby again. The question lingers: is Daisy really trying to recapture a true love that she and Gatsby had always treasured or is she filling a hole in her life left by her husband's lack of attention? What we do learn is that Gatsby's plans to recover his lost love fall apart when Daisy refuses his plea to acknowledge that she never loved her husband, and Tom promises better treatment in the future. Daisy then accidentally runs over the wife of the gas station owner. Tom thinks that Gatsby was driving the car and Daisy does nothing to correct this misimpression. That night, Daisy and Tom plot their escape from the messy situation, deciding to embark the next day on a trip to Europe. The gas station owner, crazed by grief and brandishing a gun, confronts Tom who tells him that Gatsby was the driver of the car that killed his wife. Following Tom's directions to Gatsby's mansion, the gas station owner shoots James Gatz dead. The story is narrated by Nick who comes to understand that Gatsby, despite his crimes and affectations and despite the delusion that he could recapture a love that life had passed by, was worth more than Daisy or Tom or the whole crowd of rich people and partygoers put together. Benefits of the Movie: A film version of The Great Gatsy, shown after students have read the book, can serve as an integral part of a Gatsby unit or can be used to supplement the lessons based on the book. For readers who need help comprehending the novel, the film can be used in snippets to support comprehension, promote empathic response to the characters, emphasize the literary elements, and explore theme.",The Great Gatsby,168,B0000524FD

Note: What do you do with a movie that, although loved by children, takes a Greek myth, changes the plot, modifies the characters almost beyond recognition, mixes in Christian theological themes, and adds parallels to a comic book character? One student told us about a class in mythology whose teacher had turned Hercules into a test. The prompt was simple: describe the ways in which the movie departed from the myth. Description: This film is a popular Disney rendition of the Greek myth of Heracles, which would be unrecognizable to an ancient Greek. Benefits of the Movie: See note above. Possible Problems: Major. See Description above. Parenting Points: Through changes in the plot, characters, and values promoted and by eliminating some of the horrendous events in the original myth, Disney has reshaped the story of Hercules to uphold Judeo-Christian ethics and entertain modern children. Perhaps the best thing to do if your child sees this movie is to ignore it and the film will probably go in one ear and out the other. However, if a child expresses an interest in the myth and the Greek Gods, it seems best to talk about the real myth. Errors of Mythological Proportions In this article, the name ""Heracles,"" the translation of the hero's name from the Greek into English, will refer to the mythical character. The name ""Hercules,"" the translation of the Roman name for the same hero, will refer to the Disney protagonist. Below is a list of some of the ways that the makers of Hercules altered the story of Heracles: The relationship between Heracles and his parents is changed completely. In the film, Zeus and Hera are his loving parents. In the myths, Heracles was the son of Zeus and Alcmene, the wife of a general and former king of Mycenae named Amphitryon. Zeus took the form of Amphitryon and lay with Alcmene when the general was away in battle. Hera is not happy with Zeus' infidelity and comes to hate the child when Zeus tricks her into nursing the infant for a few weeks. Zeus has the same physical traits as the common picture of Jehovah- an old man with a flowing white beard, who is good and just. Hercules' Zeus is monogamous and kind, unlike the Zeus described in Greek myths. The Greek Zeus enjoys sleeping with women, has a nasty and short temper, and does anything he wants without any qualms over the consequences. In the film, Zeus gives Hercules the flying horse Pegasus who becomes a faithful companion to his master. In the myth, Heracles did not have the Pegasus, who belonged to the hero Bellerophron. Hercules gets adopted by two loving elderly farmers, named Amphitryon and Alcmene, the name of the mother and stepfather of Heracles. Hercules doesn't know about his divine origins late in adolescence. Heracles knows that Zeus is his father from a young age. In the film, Zeus and Hera are portrayed as a loving married couple. In the Greek myth, the couple continually fought and they were often at each other's throats. In the film, Hercules is given a mentor who does not appear in the myths. His name is Philoctetes (""Phil"" in the film) and he has trained many heroes. In the myth Philoctetes was a warrior who fought alongside Heracles. Phil claims to have the mast of the Argos, the ship on which Jason and the Argonauts (including Heracles) sailed to their adventures. Phil also claims to have trained Achilles, Odysseus, Perseus, Jason, and Theseus. For this to be true, the Trojan War would have already had to have ended, but in the myths, Heracles lived long before the Trojan conflict. Phil is also a satyr, probably inspired by the myth of Chiron, who was a centaur that trained heroes. In the film, Hercules defeats the centaur Nessus while defending Megara. In the myths, Heracles kills the centaur Nessus as it was trying to rape Heracles' second wife, Deianira, while ferrying her across a river. Hercules brags to Zeus: ""You should have been there, Father! I mangled the minotaur, grappled with the Gorgon . . . "" However, in the myths, it was Theseus who killed the Minotaur and Perseus who beheaded Medusa. Hercules' relationship with Megara is also greatly changed. Megara is introduced as a maiden who sold her soul to Hades to save the life of her boyfriend who promptly abandoned her for someone else. In the myths, Megara is the daughter of the King of Thebes, and is given to Heracles to be his wife. Heracles kills Megara and their children in a fit of madness sent by the jealous goddess Hera. In the movie, Megara survives and lives happily ever after with Hercules. Hades didn't hate Hercules or try to take over Mount Olympus. Hades doesn't purchase souls (this is a Christianized element creeping into the story). Megara didn't sell her soul to Hades. The divine being who hated Heracles was Hera, who was angry at Zeus' infidelities and because Zeus tricked her into nursing Heracles. The Hades character in the film is more like the Christian Satan than the Hades of the myths. Hades was never liked by the Greeks because, being mortal and fearful of death, many considered him a hateful god. However, Hades was also viewed as neutral, being in charge of what is the Greek equivalent to Christian purgatory. In the movie, Hades is portrayed as being completely evil and has many of the physical characteristics as the Christian Satan. In the film, the underworld is portrayed as little more than Christian hell. The Hydra was in Lerna, not outside Thebes as is shown in the movie. In the film, Hades sends his two minions with a potion to kill baby Hercules. They become snakes to kidnap the child. In the myth, Heracles is abandoned by his mother Alcmene for fear of Hera's wrath and it is Hera who sends the snakes when Hercules is returned home. The Hercules in the film still has superhuman power because he did not drink every drop of the potion. In the myth, Heracles has god-like powers because Hera nursed him (while she didn't know who he was). Hades is usually portrayed as an ambiguous and only slightly evil god who does his job as needed and without any of the blatant characteristics as he has in the film. In Hercules, Hades is seen wearing all dark, with a darker shade of skin than the other gods, and flame for hair. Hades in the film is shown as having been forced to take the Underworld, and wanting to conquer Olympus as revenge upon Zeus and the other gods. In the myth, Heracles undertakes the twelve labors to atone for murdering his wife and children while in a fit of madness sent by Hera. While Heracles accepts the blame for what he did, much of the blame is assigned to Hera who had always hated Heracles. Heracles' crime and the concept of atonement are missing from the movie. Four of the twelve labors are shown and they are transmuted into situations in which Hercules is attempting to protect people from various monsters. In the movie, Hades is almost able to conquer Mount Olympus. There was no such war in the myths and no conflict between Zeus and Hades. Audiences who watch the movie learn that Zeus forced Hades to take the underworld, when in the myth Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon drew lots to see who would rule the Underworld, the Seas, and the Skies. Four labors are shown in the film: killing the lion, the boar, the bird, and the Hydra. Hercules is not shown capturing the hind, clearing the stables, capturing the bull, rounding the mares, stealing the girdle, fetching the apple, capturing the cattle, or capturing Cerebus. There is also a mention of Hercules defeating the Gorgons, which is something that Perseus did in the myths. In the film, souls are shown as something easily taken from the Underworld back into life, while in myth, the only one who was able to almost take a soul back was Orpheus and he ended up failing. Hercules dies, or comes very close to dying, but he is able to survive and become a god again. Heracles was poisoned by a shirt given to him by his second wife who had been tricked by Hera into believing that it held a fidelity charm. Heracles is, however, able to become a god, when Zeus convinces Hera to ""give birth"" to Heracles again. In the film, Hercules also gets the chance to stay a god, but since mortals are not allowed on Mount Olympus, he decides to stay on Earth with Megara and live happily as a mortal and not happily ever after. There are shades of The Odyssey in that scene. In the myth, Titans were not all brutes or personality-less monsters controlling elements as they are portrayed in the film. The Moerae are three sisters who determine the fates of humans. They do not share an eye. It was the Graiai who shared an eye. They were sea spirits and did not determine the fate of people. Hercules never met them. It was Perseus, not Hades, who stole the eye and wouldn't give it back until they told him what wanted to know. Narcissus never made it to Olympus as portrayed in the film. In the myths, he was a victim of the gods' cruelty and ended up looking at his reflection in the River Styx. In the film, the River Styx looks like a river of souls and Charon doesn't exist in the underworld of the movie. His place is taken by a skeleton. Mythically, there are nine muses not just the five shown in the film. Hercules has no siblings in the film, whereas Heracles had a half-brother, Iphicles. Zeus is portrayed in the film as being the sole reason why the Titans fell. In the myths, others participated in the war against the Titans. The climax of the movie focuses upon Hercules helping the gods overcome a revolt by Hades and the Gigantes, monsters of the Titan era. In the myths, the Titans were sent by Gaea, a Titan herself and grandmother/mother to some of the gods. She released the Gigantes as punishment for imprisoning the Titans. However the film changes it. Hades unleashes the Gigantes to take over Mount Olympus and Ancient Greece, as revenge against Zeus for forcing him into the Underworld. This is a battle that the gods will win only if Hercules can fight on their side. The Cyclops were not allies of Hades, but instead were allies of the Olympians in the war with the Titans. Hephaestus makes lightning bolts for Zeus. He is shown standing straight and tall. However, in Greek mythology, Hephaestus was a cripple. The Titans didn't attack Zeus. It was Zeus who attacked his father Cronos and the Titans. Hercules rejects the life of a god on Olympus and lives as a mortal with Megara. In the myth, after Hera poisoned him with the cloak, he died. However, on the funeral pyre Heracles becomes immortal. He is reconciled with Hera who gives him her daughter Hebe in marriage. Hercules lives on Olympus with his new wife and a new family. Links to the Internet: Hercules Script - Dialogue Transcript; Review by Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times.",Hercules,176,B00004R99S

177,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/hotel-rwanda.html,"These films describe different aspects of the Rwandan genocide. From April to July 1994, some 927,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were shot or hacked to death. The perpetrators were the Hutu-dominated army, the Interahamwe militia, and the neighbors and friends of the victims. The international community - in particular, the United States, Western Europe and the U.N. - knew what was going on but stood by and did nothing. ""Hotel Rwanda"" tells how Paul Rusesabagina protected 1,268 people who took refuge in the Hotel Mille Collines. Like ""Schindler's List,"" this movie paints an inspiring portrait of one man's evolving moral conviction and how, using his wits and charm, he held maniacal killers at bay. ""Sometimes in April"" has a broader sweep, recounting the stories of many victims of the genocide. In addition, the film describes the situation of three fictional survivors. Martine, a teacher at a Catholic girls' school, lives with the memory of seeing her class massacred. Augustin is a Hutu who had married a Tutsi. His wife and sons were murdered trying to escape. His daughter was a student in Martine's class. Augustin's brother, Honore, was a hate-mongering announcer for Radio RTLM. As the story begins, Honore is on trial before the International War Crimes Tribunal for inciting people to commit genocide. ""Sometimes in April"" shows the genocide in a series of flashbacks. Scenes of documented atrocities are recreated in the movie, including: the murder of young girls at a Catholic school, Hutu and Tutsi alike, when the Hutu girls refused to give up their Tutsi classmates; the killing of moderate Hutu Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana; and the repatriation of mostly white foreign nationals by French and Belgian troops, leaving a group of Tutsis to their fate at the hands of waiting genocidaires. ""Sometimes in April"" shows the three survivors trying to deal with the effects of the genocide. The film shows a gacaca (pronounced ga-cha-ca), a Truth and Reconciliation style village meeting used to reintegrate low level killers into society without further punishment. It also shows proceedings at the International Criminal Tribunal in Arusha at which the leaders of the Rwandan genocide are being tried for crimes against humanity. Benefits of the Movies: Both movies stay very close to the truth. ""Sometimes in April"" paints a more complete picture of the genocide, showing the horror of the hundred days and the difficulty of recovery. The film raises questions of guilt, punishment, forgiveness, and reconciliation that Rwandans must still resolve. ""Hotel Rwanda"" shows less killing and focuses on the uplifting story of an ordinary man who rises to heroic stature under the most frightening circumstances. It is an excellent lesson in courage. ""Hotel Rwanda"" also describes the difficult position of peacekeeping forces when they are not supported by the U.N. and the international community. By focusing on the daring of Mr. Rusesabagina and the survival of the refugees at the Mille Collines, ""Hotel Rwanda"" provides a cushioned introduction to the horrifying subject of the Rwandan genocide. Each of these films will acquaint students with the continuing problem of genocide. After the Holocaust the world said ""Never again."" However, since 1945, humanity has repeatedly stood by and let genocide occur. (At present the world is struggling with a genocide in Darfur.) Both movies can serve as a springboard to discussions on the legacy of colonialism and the challenges facing emerging countries in Africa. Students can explore the history and dynamics of genocide and issues of justice and forgiveness on a personal and national level. These films can also promote discussions of the potential for peacekeeping, as well as the responsibilities of individuals and the media in times of crisis. Possible Problems:     SERIOUS: Both films show the murders of many people. However, there is no gratuitous violence, and care has been taken to avoid making the images too graphic. Scenes of people being killed with machetes are shot from a distance. But depictions of genocide are upsetting. Sensitive children might be disturbed by either of these movies.

It illuminates the struggle of a man who resists the forces of lawlessness despite the fact that no one else will stand with him. The first 15 minutes are the expository phase of the film, containing a clear presentation of setting, characters and a complication that will keep the audience interested. Background:     Will Kane, the protagonist, is ending a successful career as a marshal in what once was a crime-ridden frontier town. After years of hard work, Kane secured the conviction of Frank Miller, the leader of the gang that had terrorized the town. Miller is now in state prison and the town is a safe place in which to live. As the movie opens, Kane is marrying a beautiful Quaker woman who has prevailed on him to move to another town and become a shopkeeper. The conflict comes into focus at the end of the wedding ceremony, when it is learned that Miller has been released from prison and is coming back for revenge. He is scheduled to arrive on the noon train. His gang has reassembled and is waiting. Kane is unwilling to leave the town undefended until a new marshal, scheduled to arrive the next day, is sworn in. As the time for Miller's arrival approaches, every person in town, including long time friends, town officials, Kane's deputy marshal, and even his new wife, find some reason to decline the marshal's request that they stand with him in an effort to stop the outlaws.

179,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/ice-princess.html,"This is a girls' sports formula movie that exceeds the expectations of its genre. The characters grow and change in ways that ring true. Casey is an ugly duckling high school physics geek whose mother has groomed her for Harvard. To become a graceful swan on ice, Casey must make her mother understand that Harvard is her mother's dream, not Casey's. She must also overcome her mother's disdain for women who pursue a sport. When Casey finally makes it to the ice, not only must she beat the competition, she must survive the stratagems of the skating rink owner (Tina). This woman will stop at nothing to ensure that her own child (Gen) makes it to the regional finals. Gen, it turns out, is tired of training most of the day, trying to live Tina's dream of glory on ice. A subplot details Gen's efforts to live a normal life in which she can see her boyfriend and go to parties. She even wants time to study so that she doesn't look like an idiot in math class. A second subplot involves the romance between Tina's son and Casey.",,"""Ice Princess"" shows mothers trying to live their lives through their daughters and daughters strong enough to choose their own paths. The girls manage to remain loving despite their mothers' mistakes. The story demonstrates that family and personal conflicts can be resolved with caring. ""Ice Princess"" shows women excelling in sports and gives children a peek at the tough world of competitive ice skating. In conjunction with Bend It Like Beckham the movie provides an excellent opportunity to discuss the way to approach making an ethical decision.","MODERATE. In this movie, Casey and Gen are placed in difficult positions by their mothers' insistence that their daughters live out the mothers' dreams. The result is that the children lie for a time while they work out how to resolve their situations. Casey, the heroine, doesn't want to hurt her mother's feelings by insisting on skating. So, she lies and trains behind her mother's back. On a rigorous analysis, this is not a sufficient reason to lie to a parent because if Casey had been willing to insist on skating, her mother would not have forbidden her to do it. But much of the fault goes to Casey's mother who didn't listen to her daughter and didn't support her daughter's dream of figure skating. Casey's lie allowed her time to decide what she was going to do. Eventually, she told her mother and their relationship began to right itself. Gen lies to her mother about going to a party to see her boyfriend. This was because her mother insisted on a rigorous training schedule so that Gen could be the champion skater. But this was her mother's dream and not Gen's. Soon after the party, Gen confronted her mother and demanded a normal teenage life. One of the benefits of this change in their relationship was that Gen could go to parties without lying about it. Again, a formal ethical analysis would not condone Gen's lie, but both of these characters are basically good kids and the lies were a temporary solution while they worked out how to deal with the uncomfortable positions their mothers had placed them in. This movie has been criticized for spreading stereotypes, particularly the stereotype that a girl must be beautiful and graceful and not concerned with science or professional accomplishments. While ice skating is difficult and requires work and discipline, it is still a ""girl"" thing to do. These problem can be turned into strengths through frank discussions or they can simply be ignored without much ill effect if parents and teachers stress the positive aspects of the film. Parenting Points:     A good time to show this film is after your child has seen one of the exciting and beautiful ice skating competitions that appear on television. If your child doesn't know about the prestige of a Harvard University education, explain the perceived value of an Ivy League degree. After watching the film, tell your child that if you ever act like Casey's mother, or Gen's when she tried to force her daughter to skate, he or she needs to tell you and the family will sit down and talk about it. You don't want him or her sneaking around your back. No promises about what you will do, but the family will talk. Decide how you want to approach the two negatives in the film: stereotypes and the girls' lies to their mothers. You can ignore these issues and stress the positive aspects of the movie. Or you can discuss the negatives. If you decide to discuss them, challenge the stereotype that pretty girls aren't good at science and that competitive ice skating is something particularly feminine. You can discuss why Gen and Casey lied to their mothers (see Possible Problems section above). If your child is over 13 years of age, watch Bend It Like Beckham. If your child is less than 13, describe the difference between the situations faced by Casey in this movie and by Jess in ""Bend It Like Beckham"". Jess' parents forbade her to play soccer (football) and being a professional soccer player was Jess' dream. But her parents wouldn't even consider it. Jess would have had to give up soccer unless she lied. Explain how Casey was in a different situation because her lie, while understandable, was only so that she would not hurt her mother's feelings. If this is an issue for your child, review and go through the exercise set out for an ethics class in A Unit on Honesty for an Ethics Class. Note that Casey's choice is brought up at the end of the exercise. In summary, Casey's mother would have let her skate if Casey had described how much skating meant to her and insisted upon it. This meant that there was no justification for Casey's lie.",,"LEARNING GUIDE TO: Ice Princess SUBJECTS — Sports/Figure Skating; SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL LEARNING — Breaking Out; Parenting;         Mother/daughter; Sportsmanship; MORAL-ETHICAL EMPHASIS — Trustworthiness; Respect; Fairness; Caring.

The film introduces an ambitious English politician, Sir Robert Chiltern. When he was a young assistant to a member of the British Cabinet, Chiltern had given a foreign investor advance notice of a government decision. This information permitted the investor to make a large amount of money. Chiltern's fee for the information had made the young man moderately wealthy. When the story opens, Chiltern is a rising member of Parliament with an impeccable reputation. The foreign investor has died and no one, or so Chiltern thinks, knows how he obtained his wealth. This includes his morally upright and self-righteous wife, to whom he is devoted. However, the foreign investor, while on his deathbed, had given evidence incriminating Chiltern to a lady friend. The woman, Mrs. Cheveley, has made a large investment in a proposal to build a canal in Argentina. The plan is really a stock swindle and she knows it. If the British government backs the plan the stock will rise in value. Mrs. Cheveley will be able to sell out before the scheme collapses and make a large profit. Chiltern, now an Undersecretary in the British Cabinet, has been assigned to investigate the canal project. Mrs. Cheveley contacts him. She offers to give him the incriminating evidence and a substantial amount of money if he makes a false report supporting the scheme. If Chiltern does not comply, Mrs. Cheveley will publish the evidence, disgrace him, and end his political career. When Chiltern courageously condemns the canal swindle in Parliament, an action that he believes will lead to his own exposure and disgrace, an ingenious twist of the plot permits him to retain his money, his good name, and his career. However, the Chiltern character makes no attempt to atone for his past corrupt actions nor does he disgorge his ill-gotten gains. Instead, the film celebrates the fact that he will be permitted to escape censure because he has shown that he now has moral character and will not act corruptly again. If ""An Ideal Husband"" merely entertained us with the foibles of English ""society"" (see e.g. The Importance of Being Earnest) the ethical issues would be trivial. However, the film has impressive strengths. The characters seem to break out of the artificiality of the usual comedy of manners. They show us that blackmail should be resisted, politicians should be courageous, spouses should be forgiving, and friends should stand by each other. But at the end of the film. the comedy of manners reasserts itself and Sir Robert escapes from disgrace, without even a thought about the moral implications of his position. The strengths of the earlier parts of the film and empathy for the characters may mislead a viewer into thinking that this is a morally acceptable result. Therefore, parents and teachers should make some comment about the issue of whether Sir Robert should have continued his career without disclosing his corrupt past. For example, a class or children in the family can be asked, ""Do you think that Sir Robert got off too easily? Should he at least have told the public what he had done in the past and given up the money he made by selling a state secret?"" Explain that ""An Ideal Husband"" is unlike most comedies of manners because the viewer can take most of it seriously, except for the ending. If the children argue that it was alright for Sir Robert to continue his career while hiding his corrupt past, you have the kind of debate that will enliven classroom and family discussions and bring out the issues inherent in the movie.

There are short scenes of nudity including brief glimpses of people in a nudist colony and a short scene in which a young Scandinavian woman appears without her top and without embarrassment. There is nothing sensual about the scenes of nudity. There are brief scenes referring to lovemaking that has just occurred or in which we can only hear murmuring and laughter or see people after lovemaking. There is some profanity and crude language. McCandless is badly beaten by a railroad bull. Squirrels and a moose are killed for food, and the audience is shown a squirrel being roasted and the moose being cut-up and dismembered. McCandless is shown slowly wasting away and then dying. TWM advises using this movie despite its R rating because the benefits of the film far outweigh any negatives. Two reasons are given for the R rating: gross language and nudity. Most of the gross language is uttered by the hippie Rainey in brief comments while McCandless is doing sit-ups. Adults concerned about this language can turn the volume down for three or four seconds during this scene. The remaining profanity consists of infrequent examples of garden variety four letter words that teenagers have heard many times. The nudity is simply three women shown going about their lives. There is one scene in which a Scandinavian girl is talking with her boyfriend and McCandless without wearing anything above the waist. There is also a fleeting glimpse of two women walking at a nudist colony. There is nothing sensual about either of these scenes. Because of the R rating, TWM strongly recommends getting administrative and parental permission before showing the film. See TWM's Movie Permission Slip.

In short order, Mark is rejected by a beautiful woman, gets fired from his job, and is about to be evicted from his apartment. The movie shows how Mark discovers the ability to lie while poking fun at modern society and some of our most cherished institutions. Rationale for Using the Movie: This humorous film is an excellent example of social satire, a literary genre that began with the plays of Aristophanes and has continued in all art forms through the ages. Examples in literature include, Candide, Gulliver's Travels, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and Catch 22. This film, like all good social satire, has meaning beyond the laugh, spoofing social status, social conventions, religion, advertising, and more. Objectives/Student Outcomes Using this Learning Guide: Students will learn about social satire through exposure to an excellent example of the genre. Students will examine how the techniques of satire work and exercise their skills in literary analysis and writing. Possible Problems: Minor: There are references to masturbation and sex. Like all good social satire, The Invention of Lying challenges strongly held beliefs and important institutions, including religion. It will infuriate some, but give new perspectives to all.",The Invention of Lying,194,B00275EHBY
187,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/iron-jawed-angels.html,"Frustrated by the failure of the United States to adopt a constitutional amendment giving women the vote, militant suffragists led by Alice Paul mount an aggressive campaign demanding suffrage. They used parades and demonstrations with striking visual messages, campaigned against the Democratic party, which would not endorse the Amendment, and engaged in sustained picketing of the White House. The demonstrations were entirely peaceful and the banners often used the words of Woodrow Wilson, who was president at the time, to argue the justice of their cause. After the U.S. entered the First World War in 1917, many people expected all citizens to join together to support the war effort. The militant suffragists refused, noting that they had not been permitted to participate in making the decision on whether or not to go to war. They also pointed to the hypocrisy of a nation that was fighting a war to ""make the world safe for democracy"" but which refused to allow the vast majority of its female citizens to vote. The response was violent. Angry crowds assaulted the protesters and the police did little or nothing to protect them. Instead, the suffragists were arrested on false charges of blocking the sidewalk, convicted without due process of law, and sent to jail. In jail, they were confined in poor conditions and given rancid, wormy food. Their claim to be treated as political prisoners was rejected. Other inmates were incited by the guards to attack them. When some of the women protested their mistreatment, they were placed in solitary confinement. When the women went on hunger strikes in response, they were brutally force-fed. The government tried to have their leader, Alice Paul, declared insane so that she could be committed indefinitely, but its chief psychiatrist, after interviews with Miss Paul, decided that she was of sound mind. Word of the women's mistreatment got out and was publicized by the militants and their supporters. The public outcry was immense. The suffragists were applying all of the principles of nonviolent mass action: meeting violence with peacefulness; generating massive publicity; applying political or economic pressure; and making arguments that worked on the conscience of the general public and of their adversaries. The militants' campaign kept the suffrage issue in the forefront of the national consciousness and was a factor in leading President Wilson to change his position and work actively for passage of the 19th Amendment.",,"This movie can be used to vividly impress upon students the following important historical lessons not taught in textbooks: (1) when the militant wing of the suffrage movement, led by Alice Paul, used nonviolent protests to demand the vote, they were assaulted by crowds of men and denied police protection; (2) the government tried to suppress the militants' nonviolent protests with false arrests, unfair trials, imprisonment in harsh conditions, and what can best be described as torture; (3) the militant suffragists withstood the violence, imprisonment and torture, continuing their protests and refusing to back down, while strictly adhering to nonviolence; (4) the arguments of the militant suffragists and the public's outrage at the way they were treated, as well as respect for the strength of the suffragists' commitment, were factors in the passage of the 19th Amendment, although the efforts of the National American Women's Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and its leader, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, were probably more important factors in passing the amendment; and (5) Alice Paul and the NWP independently developed tactics of nonviolent protest which were strikingly similar to the methods of promoting political and social change being developed at about the same time by Mahatma Gandhi. The film will inspire students to study the movement for women's equality, one of the five great advances in human rights in the U.S. since the beginning of the 20th century. The others were the grant of equal treatment for black Americans and other minorities, the procedural protections given to persons accused of crimes (achieved primarily through court decisions), granting access and other rights to the disabled (achieved through legislation) and the grant of equal rights to homosexuals, including the right to raise children and to marry. While all these advances are works in process, the last has been only partially realized and is still controversial today. Possible Problems:     MODERATE. There are a number of historical errors and distortions in the film. See Helpful Background Section. These problems can be briefly corrected and turned into strengths by discussing them. For a more extensive correction students can be given TWM's student handout, Alice Paul and the Struggle for the 19th Amendment: What Really Happened. Parenting Points:     All that is necessary is to show the film and to point out that the scenes relating to the militant's efforts and their arrest and imprisonment are reasonably accurate. Correct the historical errors by stating that while Alice Paul and her militants played an important role in getting the vote for women, Mrs. Catt and her organization probably deserves more of the credit. Certainly, they deserve more credit than they were given in the movie. It was NAWSA, under Mrs. Catt's leadership, which did the basic political work of creating suffrage organizations in most states, getting states to adopt women's suffrage and working with the President. In addition, not shown in the movie is the fact that once President Wilson was converted to the suffragist side, he worked actively to get the 19th Amendment passed in Congress and ratified by the states. His political intervention was crucial in the success of the campaign to pass the amendment. Children are often interested in specific scenes that are accurate portrayals of real events.

But George Bailey's responsibilities to his family and to his community kept him from leaving the small town where he grew up. He held down a responsible job, raised a family, treated people decently, and helped out whenever he could. One tumultuous Christmas Eve, Bailey is shown how much he has meant to those around him and that happiness can be found in family, friends and fulfilling responsibility, right in your own home town. This charming Hollywood classic is almost as fresh today as when it was released in 1946. Many think it's a better Christmas story than A Christmas Carol. Many say it's one of the greatest films ever made. If they're wrong, they're not off by much. The movie is suitable for viewing at any time of the year.",,"""It's a Wonderful Life"" teaches that everyone can make a difference by living a responsible, caring life. In addition, it presents the counterargument to the contention that young people should follow their own star, leave the community in which they grew up, and go out into the world. In the view of this film, a wonderful life depends upon family, friends and having an honest job that contributes to the community. Finding the right balance between self-fulfillment and dedication to others is a major developmental task, indeed, it is a challenge for all age groups. This movie contains valuable lessons for the 21st century, especially in these days of rampant corporate and business greed. Bailey, as head of the town's savings and loan association, keeps his own salary at a reasonable level. He makes sure that the S & L is operated for the benefit of its members and serves the interests of the community. He has a lifelong competition with the town's richest businessman who, despite his vast wealth, will do anything to make another buck. Possible Problems:    Minor. ""It's a Wonderful Life"" posits a simplistic religious view of angels in heaven who look after individuals on earth and answer their prayers. This is not intended to be taken seriously. Perhaps a greater problem with the movie is that the villain, Mr. Potter, gets away with his greed and a serious crime, although he is denied any triumph over George Bailey. Harry Bailey (George's younger brother) playfully chases the black maid into the kitchen in a scene that would not be permitted today. George Bailey approves a loan from the S & L to a friend (hard not to do in such a small town).

191,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/james-journey-to-jerusalem.html,"James is a bright, but naive, African Christian young man. Selected to become the minister for his village, he is sent on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The village chorus gives James his instructions: ""come back and tell us about the place where our dream lies."" Once in Israel, diverted by the lures of materialism, James finds himself on a different and more important journey. The story is a charming parable about the limits of the profit motive and the need to find one's own holy place, despite the temptations of contemporary life. ""James' Journey to Jerusalem"" is funny and affecting. The characters are well drawn, rounded, and complex. The acting and production values are excellent. The lilting, bittersweet African/Levantine flavors of Ehud Banay's prize-winning musical score add dimension and charm to the movie. Benefits of the Movie: ""James' Journey to Jerusalem"" teaches an excellent lesson about the seduction of material culture and the importance of keeping sight of your goals. James' real journey is to unregulated, out of control capitalist materialism and back to a more balanced life of spiritualism, meaningful relationships, and trust. The over-arching theme of the movie is timeless and universal: everyone is on a journey to find what will make them truly happy, but many of us are lured away from our goal by one or more of the seductions of contemporary life (for example, money, material goods, alcohol, drugs, gambling, bad associations). To find fulfillment, we need to leave these behind and resume our journey. The movie is an Israeli exercise in self-criticism that has important lessons for any affluent capitalist society. It is especially relevant to those which benefit from immigrant labor (the U.S., Canada, and Western Europe). It also: (1) provides an opportunity to describe the differences between the great economic theories of the 19th and 20th centuries: capitalism, communism, and socialism; (2) serves as an antidote to white racism and class discrimination because the character the viewer identifies with is black and the viewer sees the world through his eyes; (3) introduces and explores the archetype of the pilgrimage; (4) is an excellent example of a parable; and (5) contains good examples of the literary devices of symbolism, irony, plot development, and character.

Helpful Background: JAMES' JOURNEY, CAPITALISM, AND THE AMERICAN DREAM:      Is it wrong for a labor broker like Shimi to go to the holding tanks where illegal immigrants are being kept before they are sent back home, pick the most likely workers, pay their bail, and give them work? As long as it is legal, as long as the wages paid the workers are fair, and if the interest charged on the bail money is reasonable, it's fine. The boss should also help those who want to get ahead acquire an education or a skill. See Discussion Question #11. This film is an indictment of materialism in Western civilization when it erodes other values. It is also an indictment of capitalism when it doesn't protect vulnerable workers. There is, however, another side to the tale. In the American Dream (and the Israeli Dream as well), the immigrant comes to the country and pays his passage. (Remember the years that immigrants to the American colonies endured in indentured servitude?) After a period of time the immigrant is free of these obligations and can strike out on his own to make a life for himself in the new land.

Age: 12+; No MPAA Rating but suitable for any age; Drama/Comedy; 2003; 87 minutes; Color; Available from Amazon.com. Description:     James is a bright, but naive, African Christian young man. Selected to become the minister for his village, he is sent on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The village chorus gives James his instructions: ""come back and tell us about the place where our dream lies."" Once in Israel, diverted by the lures of materialism, James finds himself on a different and more important journey. The story is a charming parable about the limits of the profit motive and the need to find one's own holy place, despite the temptations of contemporary life. ""James' Journey to Jerusalem"" is funny and affecting. The characters are well drawn, rounded, and complex. The acting and production values are excellent. The lilting, bittersweet African/Levantine flavors of Ehud Banay's prize-winning musical score add dimension and charm to the movie. Benefits of the Movie: ""James' Journey to Jerusalem"" teaches an excellent lesson about the seduction of material culture and the importance of keeping sight of your goals. James' real journey is to unregulated, out of control capitalist materialism and back to a more balanced life of spiritualism, meaningful relationships, and trust. The over-arching theme of the movie is timeless and universal: everyone is on a journey to find what will make them truly happy, but many of us are lured away from our goal by one or more of the seductions of contemporary life (for example, money, material goods, alcohol, drugs, gambling, bad associations). To find fulfillment, we need to leave these behind and resume our journey. The movie is an Israeli exercise in self-criticism that has important lessons for any affluent capitalist society. It is especially relevant to those which benefit from immigrant labor (the U.S., Canada, and Western Europe). It also: (1) provides an opportunity to describe the differences between the great economic theories of the 19th and 20th centuries: capitalism, communism, and socialism; (2) serves as an antidote to white racism and class discrimination because the character the viewer identifies with is black and the viewer sees the world through his eyes; (3) introduces and explores the archetype of the pilgrimage; (4) is an excellent example of a parable; and (5) contains good examples of the literary devices of symbolism, irony, plot development, and character.

""The King and I"" is banned in Thailand because it presents a skewed view of King Mongkut and his accomplishments.

King Mongkut was a very civilized and well educated man and the Thais are justly proud of him. ""The King and I"" is not about Siam, King Mongkut, or Prince Chulalongkorn. It's a musical entertainment based on Western perceptions of people in countries considered to be exotic or ""uncivilized."" This should be pointed out to children who see this film. It was not Anna Leonowens who was the driving force behind Siam's modernization. ""Anna"" was merely a teacher brought in as a small part of the overall strategy of King Mongkut. Again, this should be pointed out when showing the film. The final necessary correction to this film is that the presentation of Buddhism is grossly inaccurate.

There is a Hooverville on the outskirts of town and the so-called respectable people are terrified of the hobos who live there. To survive the hard economic times, Kit's mother opens their house to boarders, which brings in many fascinating characters. Kit's mother allows two children from the Hooverville to do work around the house in return for food and clothing. The two children become Kit's friends; her loyalties are tested when a robbery occurs and one of her new friends is fingered as the culprit. Benefits of the Movie:     This film is a tender reminder that those who are down and out deserve support, compassion and respect. Hard times can happen to anyone. The movie has strong female role models, including both Kit and her mother, who treat everyone with respect and help those less fortunate, even when they themselves are running out of money. Kit also has dreams of becoming a reporter, and plasters pictures of successful women onto her tree house walls; by working at her writing, and never giving up on her dream, Kit ultimately gets an article published in the local newspaper. ""Kit Kittredge"" also shows how people with ulterior motives can whip up hatred of minority groups, in this case the hobos, to serve their nefarious ends. Possible Problems:     MINOR. The subject matter (impoverished families, broken homes, financial worries, etc.) might upset or worry younger or more sensitive children. Parenting Points:     This is a worthwhile watch for a family. Be prepared for children to ask about your own financial stability, or if you'll ever have to ""sell eggs"" to get by. Have children talk to relatives about their experience with the Great Depression. Did they ever have to take in boarders? How was life different between now and then? Review the Projects and Activities, and pick a few to do with your child. If appropriate for your child, discuss the similarities between what happened during Kit's time and what is going on with today's economic recession.",Kit Kittredge,205,B000WGVEAC

206,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/lincoln.html,Description: This lesson plan covers efforts in the U.S. to emancipate the slaves culminating in the 13th Amendment and the removal of Constitutional protections for slavery.,Rationale: The decision to emancipate the slaves and to reject the bargain between North and South that gave Constitutional protection to slavery is one of the most important developments in U.S. history. President Abraham Lincoln is among the three greatest Presidents in U.S. history. The film Lincoln provides visual and emotional depth as well as a dramatic high point to the unit. This lesson plan allows teachers to use the film Lincoln without introducing errors of historical perspective.,,,"Objectives/Student Outcomes Using this Lesson Plan: Students will understand the broad social movement that resulted in the emancipation of the slaves. They will retain striking visual images of Abraham Lincoln, Thaddeus Stevens, and the passage of the resolution sending the 13th Amendment to the States for ratification — all within the context of the broad effort to end slavery in the U.S. They will understand why the 13th Amendment was necessary to invalidate protections for slavery written into the Constitution by the Founding Fathers. Students will be motivated to do their best on research and writing assignments.","TWM LESSON PLAN THE END OF AMERICA'S NIGHTMARE DANCE WITH SLAVERY USING SPIELBERG'S LINCOLN SUBJECTS —U.S./1812 - 1865; Biography; SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL LEARNING — Leadership; MORAL-ETHICAL EMPHASIS — Citizenship. Age: 13+; MPAA Rating -- PG-13 for an intense scene of war violence, some images of carnage and brief strong language; Drama; 2012, 150 minutes; Color. Available from Amazon.com. Warning to Teachers: Watching this film is such a strong experience that showing the movie without proper scaffolding risks leaving students with the misimpression that Emancipation consisted of a month of rancorous debate and political logrolling in the House of Representatives. This Lesson Plan provides the information, discussions, and assignments to allow teachers to use the film without students retaining that misimpression. The materials below present the movie as an integral part of a unit on the end of America's nightmare dance with slavery. Steven Spielberg's Lincoln is a well-researched work of historical fiction that conveys a reasonably accurate impression of the events of January 1865. The movie has many important strengths. Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Abraham Lincoln is by far the best characterization of the man recorded on film. The acting and writing for the character of Thaddeus Stevens should lead to a new appreciation for this almost forgotten leader of the Radical Republicans. Stevens' view of race relations was a hundred years ahead of its time. The movie contains one of the best historical extrapolations, whether on film or in print, of Lincoln's reasons for demanding that the 1865 lame-duck session of the House of Representatives join the Senate in proposing the 13th Amendment to the States. The complications posed by the Confederate Peace Commission are well-represented, as are Mary Lincoln's desperate efforts to prevent the Lincolns' oldest son from enlisting in the army. The Lincolns' grief at the death of their middle son, Willie, and the Lincolns' sometimes difficult marriage are also shown. The use of Lincoln as an aid to education is complicated by its narrow focus on the legislative process during January of 1865. The film ignores the fact that ""Emancipation ? like all far-reaching political change ? resulted from events at all levels of society, including the efforts of social movements to change public sentiment and of slaves themselves to acquire freedom. . . .   Slavery died on the ground, not just in the White House and the House of Representatives."" Professor Kate Masur. Thus, the tremendous contributions to the anti-slavery cause made before 1865 by abolitionists, African-Americans (particularly black soldiers and the contrabands), the Congress, the Union Army, the Republican Party, and Abraham Lincoln himself are virtually ignored by the movie. The film also fails to mention the growing support for abolition among many in the American public that had, a few short years before, been overwhelmingly opposed to emancipation. There is scant mention of the change of position, due to conviction or political calculation, by a number of War Democrats who came to favor abolition. In fact, the historical record shows that before January 1865, so many blows had been struck against slavery that it would have been almost impossible for the nation's ""peculiar institution"" to recover. This is not shown in the movie. In order to maximize the educational benefits of the film, TWM has created a lesson plan that uses the movie for what it actually is, the story of an important but relatively short segment in the long and difficult struggle to emancipate the slaves. The lesson plan starts with student reports that will present the information necessary to understand how slavery was ended in the U.S. up to the point where the movie takes over. After students have seen the film and developed a strong personal identification with Abraham Lincoln, they will be required to read on their own or out loud in class excerpts of Lincoln's important speeches and writings. This will: (a) enhance students' appreciation of Lincoln's eloquence; (b) review basic historical lessons of the Civil War period; and (c) turn students' attention from the movie toward the historical record. Finally, the lesson plan takes the emotional interest generated by the film to promote class discussion and drive assignments. This lesson plan will require approximately two to three weeks of class time and substantial preparation by teachers. However, the benefits will be great because it will focus students' attention on what is probably the most important event in the first hundred years of the republic. For those educators who would like to use the movie, the introduction is necessary to avoid exaggerating the importance of the legislative battle of January 1865, thereby introducing historical error in the presentation of the history of emancipation. Description: This lesson plan covers efforts in the U.S. to emancipate the slaves culminating in the 13th Amendment and the removal of Constitutional protections for slavery. Rationale: The decision to emancipate the slaves and to reject the bargain between North and South that gave Constitutional protection to slavery is one of the most important developments in U.S. history. President Abraham Lincoln is among the three greatest Presidents in U.S. history. The film Lincoln provides visual and emotional depth as well as a dramatic high point to the unit. This lesson plan allows teachers to use the film Lincoln without introducing errors of historical perspective. Objectives/Student Outcomes Using this Lesson Plan: Students will understand the broad social movement that resulted in the emancipation of the slaves. They will retain striking visual images of Abraham Lincoln, Thaddeus Stevens, and the passage of the resolution sending the 13th Amendment to the States for ratification — all within the context of the broad effort to end slavery in the U.S. They will understand why the 13th Amendment was necessary to invalidate protections for slavery written into the Constitution by the Founding Fathers. Students will be motivated to do their best on research and writing assignments.",Lincoln,214,B00BOLE7X0

The film is a Disney animation with excellent music.",,"""The Lion King"" deals with the death of a parent, betrayal, guilt, running away, denial, ambition, coming of age, redemption, and friendship. See Social-Emotional Learning and Ethical Emphasis Discussion Questions. The film can serve as an introduction to Africa, food chains, the interdependence of the hunter and the hunted, lions, hyenas, meerkats, and warthogs. The movie contains an excellent example of an adult manipulating a child that can be used to help children identify, defend against, and report this type of conduct. (See An Example of Manipulative Conduct by an Adult below). Finally, this movie can introduce children to the fact that Africa has a history of rulers and conquests some of which has come down to us in oral traditions. See Sundiata in the Helpful Background section.","MODERATE. This animated feature contains disturbing violence. We therefore do not recommend it for children below the age of eight. Parents or teachers of sensitive eight year olds should probably wait a year or two before they show the film. The violence includes: blood thirsty hyenas chasing Simba; a wildebeest stampede from which Simba is saved in the nick of time by Mufasa, his father; the murder of Mufasa by Scar, Mufasa's brother (Scar throws Mufasa off a cliff into the herd of stampeding wildebeests); and a violent fight at the end of the movie between Simba and Scar. Simba grieves touchingly for his father. This could upset sensitive children especially if there has been a recent death in the family. (This could also be a strength of the film, allowing a child who has suffered a loss that he or she has not dealt with to find an outlet for his or her grief.) For some, the message of the film may be overpowered by the infectious musical numbers in the ""hakuna matata"" scenes (""you won't get hurt if you don't care about anything therefore to avoid being hurt, don't care about anything"") and the alluring personalities of Timon (the meerkat character) and Pumbaa (the warthog character). After the movie is over, adults should point out that by the end of the film, not only Simba but also Timon and Pumbaa, reject ""hakuna matata"" in favor of involvement. When Simba returns to face Scar and the hyenas, Timon and Pumbaa help him out. ADVERTISEMENT Parenting Points:     Watch the movie once with your kids. Over the next several weeks or whenever your children see the movie, select a theme to emphasize in a brief discussion. See the Social-Emotional Learning Discussion Questions for ideas. TWM suggests at least pointing out that by the end of the movie none of the characters lived according to ""hakuna matata."" Even Timon and Pumbaa went to help Simba free the lions from Scar. In addition, ask the Quick Discussion Question in the sidebar relating to mistakes that Simba made. Lead children through a discussion of most of Simba's errors. These discussions can be at meals, while driving in the car, or at any quiet time. Print out this Learning Guide, show children the photographs of the real animals, and discuss some interesting facts about them. Talk a little about the concepts of the circle of life and the food chain. Give examples that the children will recognize. (See the Circle of Life.) Suggest that the children find more pictures and more information on the Internet about the animal portrayed by their favorite character. Extended quiet times are also good for sharing the story of Sundiata with children. You can read the epic myth from the sites provided in the Links to the Internet. Show your children a map of Africa and point out the modern country of Mali. That is where Sundiata lived and ruled. Be sure to review the ""It's our little secret"" scene with your kids. Very few parents will be able to get through all of this. Pick and choose just a few of the comments or discussion questions. Take your time. Most kids will watch this movie repeatedly. You can start a new discussion each time they look at it. Select the questions that will raise issues that are important to your children.",,"LEARNING GUIDE TO: THE LION KING SUBJECTS — The Environment; Science/Technology; SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL LEARNING — Grieving;Redemption; Friendship;          Ambition; Running Away; MORAL-ETHICAL EMPHASIS — Trustworthiness;Responsibility.

The child's family from the U.S. is shown as being devoid of any religion or belief system of their own. Parenting Points:     Discuss with your child as many of the concepts in the Helpful Background section as you can. Helpful Background: Buddha said that he was a teacher/therapist who recognized the cause of life's pain and despair and then proposed the cure: changing our perspective on life and the world by recognizing that pain and despair was separate from the self. When this realization is complete, a person becomes enlightened and attains a state in which the boundary of the finite self is extinguished. An enlightened person becomes one with all things, a condition beyond the limitations of body and of mind; beyond thought, feelings and will. Buddha did not claim to be divine. He was not a savior, but rather a teacher and therapist. Buddhists do not worship the Buddha, instead, they revere him. Enlightenment is not a mystical encounter with God. Rather it is an exercise in becoming more fully human by directly realizing the nature of reality. Buddha, the Enlightened One, was born in Lumbini, Nepal in the sixth century B.C.E. He was the son of the leader of a minor kingdom but early on showed interest in reflection and meditation. It is difficult to separate the reality of his life from the myth, but it is clear that he left marriage and an indulgent life for meditation and the search for Enlightenment. He rejected the Hindu caste system as well as Hindu asceticism. In about the year 528 B.C.E. Buddha experienced the Great Enlightenment. A short time thereafter, he preaching his first sermon revealing the way of salvation from suffering, the gist of Buddhism. Buddha continued to teach, gathering disciples around him for 45 years until he died from eating spoiled food at the age of 80. Buddha's teachings have influenced the lives of millions of people for more than 2,500 years. He established a religion that is one of the primary religions of the world. He rejected metaphysical speculation. He required that religious thinking be logical, a concept previously absent from Oriental religious thought. His revolt against the extremes of Hindu hedonism, asceticism, and spiritualism, and his rejection of the caste system deeply influenced Hinduism itself. Buddhism is based upon a recognition of the ""Four Noble Truths:"" (1) life is imperfect and leads to suffering (examples: birth, illness, aging, death, being tied to what one abhors, being separated from what one loves); in other words, life is not permanent; (2) the will to individual personal fulfillment is the cause of life's imperfection and suffering, i.e., a man, no matter how charitable, will be more concerned with his children getting enough to eat than with others getting enough to eat; (3) the cure to life's imperfection/impermanence/suffering is to overcome the will to individual personal fulfillment; and (4) the EIGHT FOLD PATH is the way to overcome the will to individual personal fulfillment. Buddha approached religion as a therapy to cure the inevitable tragedy of life rather than an effort to ascertain cosmological truth. THE EIGHT FOLD PATH is a rigorous course of training designed to form habits that release the individual from impulse, ignorance of self and the will to individual personal fulfillment. To embark on the Path a person must first associate himself with those who have experience following the Path, preferably a teacher who has found Enlightenment and a group of people seeking to attain Enlightenment. The eight steps are: 1. RIGHT KNOWLEDGE (belief in the Four Noble Truths); 2. RIGHT ASPIRATION (intense determination to transcend separateness and identify with the welfare of all); 3. RIGHT SPEECH (an examination of speech to determine the motives that lead to statements that are untrue and to ensure that statements are accurate and clear); 4. RIGHT ACTION (an examination of behavior and deeds to determine motives so that we only act with selflessness and charity; this leads at a minimum to the Five Precepts: (i) do not kill (strict Buddhists extend this to animals and are therefore vegetarians); (ii) do not steal; (iii) do not lie; (iv) do not be unchaste; (v) do not drink intoxicants; these are only the beginning, and an observant Buddhist must act with selflessness and charity in all other matters as well; 5. RIGHT LIVELIHOOD (certain occupations are helpful in acting rightly and others make it almost impossible; the modern emphasis is that earning a living is a means to obtaining the necessities of life and not an end in itself); 6. RIGHT EFFORT (it takes tremendous effort to curb the will to individual personal fulfillment, reign in passions and eliminate evil states of mind); 7. RIGHT MINDFULNESS (continuous alertness and self-examination; the greatness of man is based upon his self-awareness); 8. RIGHT CONCENTRATION (an understanding that our true self is vastly more wonderful than we now realize and a passion for direct experience of its full reach). The Eight Fold Path is not easy and traditionally it has been followed in a monastery into which the adherent goes for refuge. Tibetan Buddhism has a ""refuge prayer:"" I go for refuge in the Buddha, the enlightened teacher; I commit myself to enlightenment; I go for refuge in the Dharma, the spiritual teachings; I commit myself to the truth as it is; I go for refuge in the Sangha, the spiritual community; I commit myself to living the enlightened life. This film was partially inspired by the story of Sonam Wangdu (born 1992), the child of a Buddhist family from the U.S. and the great, great nephew of Deshun Rinposte III, a revered Lama of the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism. Today the two centers of the sect are in Seattle and Nepal. Deshun Rinposte rebuilt an important temple in exile in Katmandu. He predicted that he would be reborn in Seattle. Sonam Wangdu's mother had dreams while she was pregnant that her son would be a great teacher. A leader of the Sakya sect also dreamed that Sonam Wangdu was the reincarnation of Deshun Rinposte. Sonam Wangdu is now living in a monastery in Katmandu and is studying to become the leader of his sect. It is reported by those that believe in the reincarnation, that at the child's birth a golden light filled the delivery room, that the child was unusually compassionate with others, and that when taken to the room of Deshun Rinposte the child identified the Master's chair.",,"LEARNING GUIDE TO: LITTLE BUDDHA SUBJECTS — Religions/Buddhism; World/Tibet; SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL LEARNING — None.

213,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/lp-exercise-in-looking-beneath-the-surface.html,,,,,,"\ Lesson Plan — Looking Beneath the Surface What is going on beneath the surface of an event or conversation? Sometime, before having students read a novel or a short story, or watch a film or a play, introduce the lesson with a provocative concept: there are subtexts of meaning below the surface of almost every human interaction. Begin by asking what might have occurred in the mind of an individual that led to the invention of the chair? What thought drove this prehistoric person to pound together a few chunks of wood so that someone might sit? The kids will drift through various suggestions: desire for comfort, avoidance of dirt or bugs, an effort to keep dry in wet weather. To spark deeper thought, describe the scene of the school parking lot and the after-school rush to the cars in which we hear the cry ""shotgun"" ring out from kids who don't drive. They're trying to get the second most prestigious seat in the car. Then talk about status in a family. Does anyone have a family in which one member always sits at the head of the table or in the best armchair in front of the television? When appropriate, mention the difference between the chair occupied by a judge who presides over a trial and the chair in which the defendant sits. Point out the contrast between the cushy chair behind the teacher's desk at the back of the classroom and the hard and chilly seats of the students. Eventually someone gets it: power. The chair is a status symbol; it shows the power of the individual who sits. A king on his throne, an executive in a corner office, etc. Next ask students what is meant by the words exchanged in any casual greeting that they no doubt have heard a dozen times before they get to school each day. Role play, if you will. ""Hello,"" teacher says. ""Hi,"" the student responds. ""How are you?"" The teacher continues the dialog. ""Fine, and you?"" The student will likely respond. ""Fine."" The teacher ends the exchange. You might want to do another dialogue and when the student asks, ""How are you?"" Respond with a lengthy discourse on the condition of your hangnail or the problem you are having with tendonitis on your six mile jogs. Then, ask the student to do the role playing experience again. This time, have the student begin the exchange. ""Hello,"" the student will say. (You may notice that some kids point their chins a bit and say ""s'up?"" That's ok. The lesson still works.) But instead of responding with a cheery hello (or ""s'up, yourself""), simply stare at the student. Maybe he or she will repeat the greeting; you remain silent. Guaranteed, discomfort will ensue. If you stare long enough, the kids will accuse you of mad-dogging. Ask the class what you are communicating with your non-response and what this shows about the meaning of every day polite greetings. Very soon, or perhaps with some additional guidance from you, the students will realize that the standard greeting is really a culturally conditioned manner of insuring the safety of each individual in a world in which, very often, the true danger to humans is from other humans. The actual meaning of the dialogue is thus: ""I see you there before me."" ""I see you as well."" ""I am no danger to you."" ""Nor am I a danger to you."" You will find dozens of examples that show how a very serious thought lies beneath simple objects, like a chair, and beneath simple words exchanged in common greeting. Now students can read the novel or short story or watch a movie or the performance of a play, or simply live their lives, and look beneath the images they see and the words they hear.

Description:     This film is an entertaining introduction to Shakespeare's play ""Richard III"". Al Pacino and a small company of actors explain the plot, the characters, their relationships to each other, and the times in which they lived. Episodes showing the actors working on the play are interspersed with performances of important scenes. Benefits of the Movie:     This film will enhance appreciation of Shakespeare's ""Richard III"". It should be seen shortly before going to the play or watching a film of the play.

Watching this movie is a wonderful way for young actors and anyone interested in the theater to see how actors prepare to put on a Shakespearian play. Possible Problems:    MINOR. There is a little profanity and a little violence, but we know the violence is make-believe. The weakest part of the film is Pacino's self-celebration and the few instances when he talks down to his audience.",Looking For Richard,222,B00005JNHV

The tale begins in 1984 when Lorenzo, then age 5, is diagnosed with the disease. The doctors give him a prognosis of relentlessly increasing disability and death within two years. There is no treatment. The Odones do not accept this verdict and embark on a dramatic search for a way to save their son.",,"""Lorenzo's Oil"" is an enthralling medical detective story. It can serve as a motivator in the study of the scientific method, chemistry, biology, neurology, and genetics. The film is an excellent introduction to the medical research establishment and the ethics of clinical trials. Merely watching this movie is a hard-hitting life experience. It teaches courage, persistence and that sometimes motivated people can achieve what had seemed impossible. It also shows that the disabled are real people with feelings and intelligence. The film explores some of the problems in getting society to take note of and to address extremely rare diseases. The movie and this Learning Guide provide several opportunities to teach critical viewing skills. The movie contains a key factual error that provides an excellent opportunity to teach the scientific method. At the time the movie was released, scientific studies had demonstrated that Lorenzo's Oil did not work for other ALD patients who, like Lorenzo, had already developed symptoms of the disease. Lorenzo's reaction to the Oil was an anomaly. (We are not aware of any explanation for why the Oil worked with Lorenzo.) The worries of the scientists and ALD Foundation leaders about holding out false hope to families (concerns that were ridiculed in the movie) turned out to be entirely justified. Then, in a twist of fate, scientific studies completed ten years after the film was made found Lorenzo's Oil to be effective in preventing ALD in a different group of people, boys with the ALD genetic defect who did not yet have neurological symptoms. Ironically, these studies were performed by Dr. Hugo Moser. In the movie, the character modeled on Dr. Moser, Dr. Nikolais, is portrayed as the epitome of the unresponsive medical establishment. TWM's Lesson Plan -- The Development of Lorenzo's Oil, Strange Twists of Fate, and the Scientific Method uses these circumstances as the basis for an exercise in applying the scientific method and developing hypotheses in a real world situation. ""Lorenzo's Oil"" is most helpful if students are given a description of certain scientific and biological concepts before they see the film. These are provided in the Introductory Concepts Handout. TWM's scientific methods lesson plan provides a review of the process by which Lorenzo's Oil was discovered.

There are heartrending scenes showing Lorenzo's increasing disability and his coughing fits in which, unable to swallow, he chokes on his own saliva. The film may upset sensitive children. It may be a good idea to tell children as they watch this movie that it is a mostly true story, that Lorenzo, in the end, survives, although he is still seriously disabled, and that the Odones' efforts to save their son have allowed other children affected by the disease to live happy and productive lives. Some viewers may be distracted by Nick Nolte's heavily accented English. However, Nolte simply provides a fair rendition of how the real Augusto Odone sounds when he speaks English.

This film presents a limited and uncritical view of Sir Thomas More. Because of its inaccuracies and omissions, the film has been strongly criticized by Richard Marius, author of a respected biography of More. Several years ago, based on Marius' criticisms, we declined to prepare a Learning Guide for this film. However, many people disagreed with us and felt that the story of a man who gave up everything for a principle could serve as a valuable teaching tool. In addition, we are informed that the film is widely used for this purpose by teachers in England. After reading several biographies of More and much reflection, we agree with both the proponents and the critics of this film. As a result of its historical inaccuracies ""A Man for All Seasons"" is not a film to simply show or recommend with the implication that ""this is the way it was."" There is too much here that is the way it wasn't, or at least there is too much that is the subject of controversy among historians.

The Li's are loving and close, enduring decades of hunger and deprivation, barely avoiding starvation. The book describes a peasant's life in China before, during and after the Cultural Revolution (1966 to 1976). At age 11, Cunxin is chosen to attend Madam Mao's Dance Academy in Beijing to study both dance and Maoist ""philosophy."" Despite his initial disinterest in dance and his resentment about having to leave home, Cunxin becomes an excellent dancer and a true artist. Introduced to the U.S. through one of the first exchange programs after Mao's death and astounded at the personal and artistic freedom, as well as the standard of living in the U.S., Cunxin defects in 1981. After six years, the Chinese Communist Party allows Cunxin's parents to visit him in the U.S. Years later he is allowed to return to China and visit friends and the rest of this family. The movie is a reasonably accurate description of Mr. Cunxin's life through about his 30th year, as described in his autobiography.

At age 11, Cunxin is chosen to attend Madam Mao's Dance Academy in Beijing to study both dance and Maoist ""philosophy."" Despite his initial disinterest in dance and his resentment about having to leave home, Cunxin becomes an excellent dancer and a true artist. Introduced to the U.S. through one of the first exchange programs after Mao's death and astounded at the personal and artistic freedom, as well as the standard of living in the U.S., Cunxin defects in 1981. After six years, the Chinese Communist Party allows Cunxin's parents to visit him in the U.S. Years later he is allowed to return to China and visit friends and the rest of this family.

Instruct the class to take a piece of lined paper and to write their name, the period, and the date at the top. Then instruct them to write the phrase ""Each person's consciouness is an entire world."". Finally, ask the students to think of a person living in their own family or community. It can be a child or an adult. It can be themselves or another person. Give the class ten minutes to write down on a piece of paper a list of the most important things about the world of this person's consciousness. They should include information on this person's life: what motivates them, what interests them, who are their family and friends, what they like to do, what they're good at, which are their prized possessions, and what they love about their home. Tell students that they can also describe their fondest memories, detail their dreams for the future and explain what makes them unique or different. Tell the class that the lists will be graded on imagination, effort, grammar, and penmanship. When time is up, ask for volunteers to read their lists to the class and select three. Collect the other lists and time the presentations of the volunteers. Compliment the volunteers on their work.

245,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/music-of-the-heart.html,A popular and innovative teacher of violin at mostly black and Hispanic elementary schools in New York City is laid off due to budget cuts. The teacher refuses to accept her fate and fade away. She and the parents of her students band together to raise money to pay her salary. Can they succeed? Will the public take notice and support their efforts? Or are these children doomed to be deprived of their beloved teacher and their hope for an education in music? The film was inspired by the achievements of Roberta Guaspari and her students in the East Harlem Violin Program.,,"""Music of the Heart"" has many strengths. It shows: young children eager to learn and practice the violin; caring and nurturing inner city schools; female role models; a dedicated teacher; a dedicated principal; a crippled child overcoming her handicaps; and people of all races in the melting pot of New York City, working together to raise their children. The experiences of Ms. Guaspari and her violin program demonstrate that people can, with luck, sometimes triumph over misguided government policies. ""Music of the Heart"" will also introduce children to Carnegie Hall and to some of the great violinists of our time. The movie contains an excellent subplot about the heroine and her children dealing with their husband/father's decision to divorce the heroine.","SERIOUS: We much prefer Small Wonders, a fascinating documentary about Ms. Guaspari and her young violin students. Because the documentary shows real elementary school students working hard in class and practicing at home, as well as the actual concert at Carnegie Hall, it is more interesting to both children and adults than the fictionalized version. In addition, it does not contain many of the possible problems of the fictionalized version. The best use of this film is as a refresher, to be shown several years after children are shown ""Small Wonders"" to remind them and to confirm the lessons of the documentary. Parents and teachers should think carefully before showing this film to children whose parents are divorced or separated. The heroine and her children can be seen as the victims of an uncaring husband/father who has run off with another woman without giving the family a decent chance. Young children whose parents are separated or divorced might think that this applies to their personal situation. In addition, parents and teachers should consider starting a discussion in which the following issues are raised: Are separation and divorce a matter of fault? Should adults who don't love each other stay together for the sake of the children or because of the sanctity of marriage? Do divorce and separation have anything to do with how much parents love their children or are they about relationships between adults? What are the responsibilities of adults who are divorced or separated and who don't have custody of their children? This discussion will prepare children for this film. Some parents may object to the presentation of marriage and sexual fidelity in the film. The heroine, after her husband leaves her for another woman, has secured a teaching job and brought her children to New York. She is staying temporarily at the apartment of a man she knew in high school. He wants to have a romantic relationship with her and tries to interest her in sleeping with him. She feels the same way but hesitates because she is still married. He persuades her by remarking that her husband, at that very moment, was with another woman. No graphic sexuality is displayed. We are shown only tender kisses and the heroine in bed alone, waking up the next morning, still under the covers apparently without any clothes on. The man is never shown in bed with her. Later the relationship develops into one in which she wants commitment but he doesn't, so she tells him she can't see him any more. The man expresses some immature feelings about marriage, asserting that since half of all marriages end in divorce, he doesn't want to try for a committed relationship. Parents watching this film may decide to simply ignore these issues and talk about the other parts of the film. Most likely, these scenes will not have much of an impact on younger children watching the movie and will soon be forgotten. However, if it appears that the romantic parts of the film are having an effect on children, parents should ask questions concerning this issue (see Discussion Questions below) or explain their views on these events. Another potential problem with this film is the implicit message that superhuman efforts will be rewarded by the intervention of the famous and that adverse consequences can always be avoided. The sad fact is that Roberta Guaspari and her string program were the exception rather than the rule. During the 1990s, many music and art teachers were laid off throughout the country and their students were denied the opportunity for arts education in the public schools. Children watching this film should be told about the great loss this country suffered in the 1990s, and the losses it continues to suffer to this day, because budget cuts have forced the closure of many public school music and art programs.

Age: 14+; MPAA Rating: R for language and some marijuana use by Vietnam veterans; Drama; 94 minutes; 2007; Color. Historical Note:     Today, most people view the disabled as full-fledged citizens who have the right to participate in mainstream society as much as they can. There is a law, the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (""the ADA""), which requires that facilities open to the public be built or modified to provide access for disabled people and that they be given reasonable accommodations so that they can hold down a job. Before that time there were no such obligations. The movement to grant the disabled access to buildings otherwise open to the public and to integrate them into the work-life of the community was one of the five movements that made substantial advances in human rights in the United States during the 20th century. The other four were: (1) suffrage and civil rights for women; (2) civil rights for blacks and other minorities; (3) procedural rights for persons accused of crimes; and (4) ending discrimination against homosexuals. All of these movements are works in progress. The crown jewel of the effort to extend equal rights to homosexuals, gay marriage, was won only in 2015 with the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges. Description:     This film is a biography of Richard Pimentel (1947 - ), one of the people most responsible for the movement to recognize the disabled as full-fledged human beings. His advocacy was a major factor in passage of the ADA. As the movie opens, the audience sees Richard's rocky childhood: his mother is haunted by three miscarriages and is in and out of mental hospitals. Richard's father dies when he is a young boy. When his application for a scholarship to attend college is rejected, Richard enlists in the army and is sent to Vietnam. A mortar attack leaves him with severe tinnitus, which effectively deafens him. After he enrolls in Portland State University on the GI Bill, Richard meets the brilliant and witty Art, who is confined to a wheelchair with cerebral palsy. The two become close friends, and Richard is appalled by the discrimination that Art faces on a daily basis. Richard also meets Mike, a disabled vet with PTSD, who can't find a place in peacetime society or relief from the survivor's guilt that he feels because his best friend didn't survive. Angry at society's hostility to injured Vietnam veterans, as well as its mistreatment of handicapped civilians, Richard Pimentel finds his life?s purpose in advocating for the disabled. Actually, he becomes obsessed with his mission . . . and there are costs. Mike is unable to fight off his demons and commits suicide. Richard wonders whether Mike would have survived had Richard not been off on a speaking gig. Richard's girlfriend, Christine, feels neglected because of Richard's focus on his quest. Eventually, she leaves him. Richard Pimentel served as a consultant for the film. It portrays, with reasonable accuracy, the many important events of Mr. Pimentel's story. The film?s great pop music score and visuals bring the 1960s and 1970s into vivid relief. Benefits of the Movie: Most students are unaware of the prejudice against disabled people that existed in the U.S. in the 19th and 20th centuries. There were actually ""ugly laws"" which made it illegal for ""deformed"" people to appear in public. Americans seeking better treatment for the disabled eventually convinced local governments to repeal the ugly laws and persuaded Congress to outlaw discrimination against the handicapped in education, employment, and physical access (the ADA). These changes in the law depended on changing the way society views disabled people. Students will absorb these developments as they follow the progress of Richard's friendships with Art and Mike. Students will also learn about the plight of returning Vietnam War veterans, many of whom were not welcomed home after their service to their country. (The U.S. learned from that experience. Veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars are honored for their service and their sacrifice by virtually all Americans, even those who are against the wars. It was very different for returning veterans during the Vietnam War.) This film also presents an example of a person who had a difficult start in life and who wrestled with its effects even as he built a meaningful career. Students who have suffered early-life trauma or who are from a dysfunctional family can come to understand the connections between their personal histories and their current challenges. Perhaps they will be motivated to seek help. Benefits by Subject Matter: Social Studies: This film presents one of the five great advances in human rights in the U.S. during the 20th century: the movement to allow the disabled to integrate into mainstream society. It will show students that just a few years ago, disabled people could not get access to public buildings and could be discriminated against at work and in education. The movie also provides a window onto life in the last half of the 20th century. Health: Students love the character of Art, a man confined to a wheelchair by cerebral palsy. Art's spastic movements make even the simplest tasks of daily life extremely difficult. Michael Sheen's portrayal of this real-life character is so engaging that students' view of persons with obvious physical disabilities will change forever. The movie will also help students reach new levels of understanding about the effects of early childhood trauma, PTSD, and overcoming a dysfunctional family. Music Within is one of the best films for Health classes relating to disabilities. English Language Arts: The movie is an excellent description of the human condition as lived in America during the 20th century.

Review the Lesson Plan and decide how to present it to the class, making any necessary modifications. 2.  Retrieve from the Internet the additional film segments and photographs recommended below. Determine which are appropriate for the classes which will see the snippet. Step by Step 1.   Introduction to Segment #1: Tell students that aphids are small insects that eat plants and emit a sweet sticky substance called honeydew. Some species of ants use honeydew for food. Ants will tend the aphids, stroke them to encourage the aphids to emit honeydew, take aphids into their nests during cold weather, transport aphids or their eggs to food plants, and transfer aphids to new feeding sites. Chemicals on the feet of the ants tranquilize and subdue the aphids. Ants store excess honeydew in a separate stomach and regurgitate it for other ants when needed. Ladybugs eat aphids and many gardeners buy ladybugs to release into their gardens to kill aphids. This sequence contains an example of a predatory relationship and a symbiotic relationship. Start at the beginning of DVD Scene 2 and play it until the beginning of the segment on ladybugs mating. Closing for Segment #1: Ask students to identify the predatory and symbiotic relationships. This can be in a quickwrite or through class discussion. Diagram the flow of benefits on the board. Then ask students to describe what the activity engaged in by the ant would be called if it was performed in by a human being. Good responses will include: farming, ranching, herding, or nurturing. 2.   Introduction to Segment #2: Tell students that ants can lift five times their weight and drag an object 25 times their weight. Ants have two sets of jaws, one for holding things that they carry and one for chewing. Ask students to look carefully at what the ants are doing in the second half of the segment and to ask themselves why the ants are doing this. Start the segment at the beginning of DVD Scene 5 and play it for about 4 minutes, until the segment on wasps begins. Closing for Segment #2: Solicit students' opinions about how the ants will use the plant material they are collecting. Tell them that the leaves and plant material will be cut up by the ants and used in a fungus garden. The ants will eat the fungus. These ants are acting like farmers. 3.   Introduction Segment #3: Tell students that this segment shows what occurs in an ant colony after a large rain storm.

Review the Lesson Plan and decide how to present it to the class, making any necessary modifications. 2.  Retrieve from the Internet the additional film segments and photographs recommended below. Determine which are appropriate for the classes which will see the snippet. Step by Step 1.  Tell students that this class will be about symbiosis and predation. For students in the lower grades, define those terms. Tell students in the lower grades or elicit from class discussion the facts that bees pollinate more than flowers and that much of our food depends upon bees pollinating fruit trees, vegetable plants, and beans. Ask students to think about what the world would be like without oranges, apples, tomatoes and other fruits and vegetables. 2.  Start playing the film from DVD Scene 1. TWM recommends playing the film to the end of clip #3 with brief stops for the introductions and closings recommended in this Guide or for class discussion. This has the advantage of exposing the class to the film's introduction together with many short clips showing various insects. Playing the movie to the end of clip #3 takes about 22 minutes. You can also talk over this film; it has very little narration. Introduction to Clip #1: As the clip begins ask students if they've ever seen a plant move on its own power in response to some stimulus from the environment. This clip starts with time-lapse photography showing flowers opening. It lasts for a little more than two minutes and ends with a scene of a large tree surrounded by grass. Closing for Clip #1: Tell students that the powdery material being placed onto the bees by the plants is pollen. It might be a good idea to run the DVD back for a few seconds to show this again. 3.  Introduction to Clip #2: Tell students that aphids are small insects that eat plants and emit a sweet sticky substance called honeydew. Some species of ants use honeydew for food. Ants will tend the aphids and stroke them to encourage the aphids to give them some honeydew. Chemicals on the feet of the ants tranquilize and subdue the aphids. Ants will take aphids into their nests during cold weather, returning them to food plants when the weather warms. Ants will also transfer aphids to new feeding sites. Ants store excess honeydew in a separate stomach and regurgitate it for other ants when needed. Ladybugs eat aphids and many gardeners buy ladybugs to release into their gardens to kill aphids. Clip #2 starts with a ladybug climbing up a plant stalk to clicking sounds and lasts about 2.5 minutes. It ends with ladybugs mating. Closing for Clip #2: Ask students to identify the predatory or symbiotic relationships between bees and flowers and between aphids, ladybugs and ants. They should describe what the insects get, give or lose in each relationship. This can be in a quickwrite followed by a class discussion or it can simply be in class discussion. Diagram the flow of benefits on the board (or have a student do it). Then ask students to describe what the activity engaged in by the ants would be called if it was performed by a human being. Good responses will include farming, ranching, herding, or nurturing. 4.  Introduction to Clip #3: Tell students that spiders keep the populations of other insects in check. This clip starts as soon as the grasshoppers appear. They will soon fly into the spider's web. Clip #3 itself lasts about two minutes. It ends when the film shows a hole which turns out to be an exit for winged ants. Closing for Clip #3: Tell younger classes, if they don't already know, that spiders eat by sucking the fluids from their prey. 5.  Introduction to Clip #4: Tell the class that there are some plants that eat insects. This clip begins at DVD Scene 9 and lasts for about three minutes. It ends with a Sundew enveloping a wasp. Closing for Clip #4: Tell students that the second plant is called a Sundew. It has sticky glands on hairs which trap insects. The edges of the leaf then slowly roll over the prey as shown in the segment. These plants get their name from the glands on top of the hairs; they glisten like dew. Sundews are common in bogs and can occur on sandy banks and other mineral soils that are poor in organic nitrogen and phosphorus. The prey of the Sundew is used to supplement the nutrition that the plant gets through its roots. The glands at the end of the hairs produce digestive juices that decompose the prey.

They will relate that knowledge to surface tension and the tendency of drops to acquire and conserve a spherical shape. ,"SNIPPET LESSON PLAN FOR: Surface Tension and Molecular Bonds Using Film Clips from Microcosmos Subject:     Science/Chemistry; Molecules; Surface Tension Ages:          10+; Middle School and High School Length:      Film Clips: 7 minutes (in three segments); Lesson: The clips and related discussion will add about fifteen minutes to existing lesson plans. Learner Outcomes/Objectives:     Students will recall what they have learned about the structure of matter regarding atoms and molecules and their bonds. They will relate that knowledge to surface tension and the tendency of drops to acquire and conserve a spherical shape. Rationale:     The shape of drops is explained by the property of liquids called surface tension. Real examples as shown in the documentary Microcosmos are an appealing way to introduce this topic and to explain it in terms of intermolecular forces. Description of the Snippet:    Microcosmos shows spectacular close-ups of the daily routines of insects and other bugs. In particular, ants are shown drinking from small water drops which rest on grass leaves and keep a spheroidal shape, apparently defying gravity. Helpful Background:     Part 1 Molecules are formed when atoms combine with each other to create the substances that can be recognized by the senses, i.e., matter that people can see, touch, smell, or feel. Most molecules are made up of combination of atoms of different elements, as in the case of water, in which two atoms of hydrogen combine with one atom of oxygen to form the water molecule H2O. When atoms combine to form molecules, they build bonds that keep the atoms together unless there is an external force that breaks these bonds. (Sometimes atoms form single-atom molecules in monatomic substances, as in the case of noble gases like helium or neon. On other occasions, atoms of one element combine only with other atoms of the same element in mono-element molecules. Examples of mono-element molecules are O2 (oxygen gas) and O3 (ozone). The bonds between the molecules are called ""intermolecular forces"". Their strength determines the physical state of the molecule at various conditions of pressure and temperature. For example, water is liquid at room temperature, while nitrogen needs to be below -195.79 °C (-320.33 °F) to be liquid. An effective way to introduce young students to the states of matter is to ask four or more of them to stand in a circle joining their hands. If the teacher gently moves the circle of children from one part of the classroom to the other, still retaining the circular shape, they end up in a different place, but keep the same positions with respect to each other. This represents solid matter, e.g. a block of ice. For this piece of ice, the students are the water molecules, at fixed positions with respect to each other. If the students are asked to release each others' hands and if the group is gently pushed across the classroom, they will arrive at the other end still together, but most likely in a different configuration from the one they had at the beginning. They have mixed and moved with respect to each other. This represents a liquid; in our analogy, the ice block has melted into liquid water. The last step in this exercise is to let the students walk away from each other. They are no longer together. This would represent the gaseous state of matter, in our analogy, water vapor. In a gas, intermolecular forces are very weak or non-existent. A further step would be transforming the gas into plasma, by breaking up the atoms. Obviously, this could not be simulated with the students, but it could be explained to them that in order to get the group to represent plasma—the fourth state of matter—their bodies would need to be taken apart. — For a deeper explanation of intermolecular forces, see Intermolecular Forces from the Chemistry Department at Purdue University. Part 2 The surface of solids is impenetrable until a sufficiently large pressure is exerted on it, for example with a knife, or it is broken into pieces. In both cases the bonds between molecules becomes severed. In the case of gases, it is also easily understandable that they do not form a continuous lump of matter, as the molecules are practically independent from each other, i.e. the intermolecular bonds are very weak or non-existent. The case of liquids is interesting because the molecules seem to move freely, but at the same time stick together somehow, as is shown in the segments of Microcosmos referred to in this lesson plan. Water drops keep a quasi-spherical shape when sitting on a leaf or even while being handled by ants. So, what is the force at play here? It is called ""surface tension."" Molecules at the surface of a liquid are subject to intermolecular forces of attraction, but only towards neighboring molecules within the liquid. (See Surface Tension from About.com.) The net force acting on them is towards the bulk of the liquid, away from the surface. This results in a tendency in the liquid to adopt a shape with the smallest possible number of molecules on the surface. If pressure is applied on the surface, it is deformed and its area increases. The surface will push back against this deformation because of the attractive intermolecular forces. The liquid seeks to return to its state of equilibrium (i.e. to a state of minimum surface area). By pushing back this way the surface behaves like a membrane that can resist a certain weight before breaking, such as a paper clip or a light coin gently placed on the surface. See Science Magic 2 - Floating Paperclip!. How is this related to the tendency to adopt a spherical shape? Surface tension, like any other force, tends to act as long as it is allowed to (objects fall until they are stopped by the floor, opposite poles of magnets tend to get together until or unless something stops their motion). Recall that the force imbalance behind surface tension tries to minimize the number of molecules at the surface. Surface tension pushes the liquid together until the liquid adopts the shape with the smallest possible surface for its volume. The geometrical shape with the smallest possible surface for a given volume is a sphere. This is also seen in the images from astronauts in space handling liquids in absence of gravitation: there seems to be a force that ""pulls"" the molecules together and therefore the liquid into a spherical shape. This allows astronauts do interesting experiments with water in zero-gravity as in Waves, Bubbles and Reactions in a Free Sphere of Water. In the presence of gravity, that force also pulls the molecules in the same way, not letting it ""spread out"" over the surface it is resting on.

258,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/nutcracker.html,"This Christmas sugarplum is probably the most popular ballet in the world. It begins with a Christmas Eve party in an eighteenth century Northern European home. The mysterious godfather Drosselmeyer appears, bringing mechanical dolls which perform impressive dances before they wind down and are put away. He then gives a nutcracker doll to his favorite, young Marie (Clara in the Baryshnikov/ABT version). Her naughty brother Franz takes it from her and breaks the Nutcracker. The young girl is crestfallen but godfather Drosselmeyer repairs it. After the party, she drifts off to sleep beside the Christmas tree, cradling her beloved new doll. In a fantastic dream, the tree grows to outlandish size as magic overtakes her world. Evil mice, led by their king, try to attack Marie/Clara. In the Balanchine/NYC Ballet production, following the classic story and using the classic dances, Drosselmeyer's young nephew, who had fascinated Marie at the party the evening before, becomes the Nutcracker and defeats the Mouse-King. He then sits with Marie as the Sugarplum Fairy presents dancers to them suggested, as is frequently the case in dreams, from events of the day before: Spanish/chocolate, Arabian/coffee, Chinese/tea; Russian or Candy cane, Waltzing flowers and Whirling mirlitons/marzipan. The Baryshnikov/ABT version departs from the classic story line during the dream sequence. The Nutcracker and the Mouse-King fight and both are killed; but the mice defeat the toy soldiers. Suddenly Drosselmeyer appears, revives the Nutcracker and turns him into a handsome prince. The Nutcracker/Prince spirits Clara away through a forest of snow sprites. They arrive in the kingdom of the Sugarplum Fairy where they are royally entertained by a suite of delectable divertissements (short dances) sparked by memories of the day before: Spanish/chocolate, Arabian/coffee etc. But it is, after all, a dream and Drosselmeyer appears to summon Clara back to reality as a young girl with dreams for the future. The Balanchine/NYC Ballet offering presents the ballet as a movie production using the classical dances and following the traditional story line. This film is the best to show to very young children (under 10). The cast includes a large number of child dancers with whom they can identify. Marie is very naturally acted and well danced by Jessica Lynn Cohen. Kevin Kline's narration provides a clear framework for understanding the action. The production is spirited and entertaining. Our only criticism is that Macaulay Culkin is shamelessly miscast as Dr. Drosselmeyer's nephew, a transparent effort to attract audiences by importing a movie star. He is not a dancer and, in this production, doesn't look like much of an actor. The Baryshnikov/ABT version is better for older children, well danced and very accessible. Baryshnikov breathes new life into the ballet, departing from the standard narrative to offer a fresh psychological/developmental interpretation. Clara's dream is clearly shown as an awakening to the possibilities of romance in young womanhood. Baryshnikov retains the traditional framework cutting out some of the conventional choreography and replacing it with fresh ideas of his own. Another advantage of the Baryshnikov version is that he dances the Nutcracker/Prince role at the height of his power as a classical dancer. Gelsey Kirkland's Clara is both girlish and technically brilliant. Overall, despite a few passages that do not work, Baryshnikov's initiative in doing something new and ambitious with this ballet is a great success.",,"Filled with themes that will interest both boys and girls, this film is an excellent introduction to ballet. Older children who are interested in ballet will enjoy the technical virtuosity of the dancers. The ""Nutcracker"" can also serve as the basis for a discussion of the little girl's dream and an introduction to the role of wish fulfillment and remnant memories in the creation of dreams. ""The Nutcracker"" is frequently performed at Christmas by local and regional ballets. Many of these productions are excellent and offer close to professional quality.

When your child is ready to read the book, get it for him or her from the library. It's better than the movie. The movie teaches important lessons in social-emotional learning. It shows that a child with a dream can go far beyond family expectations. This concept is stressed in the film and parents can reinforce it by commenting on the theme or by giving examples of people known to the child who have done something with their lives that was much different than what was expected of them. Also stressed in the movie is the concept that children can prevail over daunting odds. A parental comment about how great it was that these kids didn't give up will help stress this idea.

The time is just after the Civil War and everyone is very poor. Despite initial missteps, Yeller wins his way into everyone's heart and saves the lives of several family members. In the process, he is bitten by a rabid wolf. The film is based on the novel by Fred Gipson. Benefits of the Movie: This movie shows the marginal life of frontier homesteads in the West after the Civil War. The characters exhibit the courage required to overcome the difficulties of that environment. Possible Problems: MINOR: The youngest boy, Arliss, throws rocks at his older brother and acts recklessly, placing himself in danger, all without being punished. Ignoring his mother's orders, Arliss almost allows the then rabid Yeller out of the corn crib where the dog has been confined for observation. If Yeller were to bite Arliss, the child would probably die of rabies. The failure of this movie to deal with Arliss' misbehavior can be turned into an opportunity to tell children that rocks are dangerous weapons that can put out an eye or even kill another person. You can also explain to your child that reckless children like Arliss live simply by luck, and that their lack of foresight often gets them or someone else injured or killed. (Ask your child: What would have happened if the mother had been one minute later and Arliss had let Yeller, aggressive and rabid, out of the pen?)

Helpful Background: Why did the children cling to Fagin? For a description of the oppressive system of treating the poor in England at the beginning of the 19th century, see Learning Guide to A Christmas Carol. The poor houses and orphanages were a part of that system. The children were required to work long hours and received precious little for it. The adult operators of these establishments often used them for their own profit. This was the life facing the Artful Dodger and the other children if they left Fagin. Oliver Twist was Charles Dickens' second novel and was originally published as a serial in a popular magazine from February 1837 to April 1839. The character of Oliver Twist the novel was the first child protagonist in an English novel. The book attempts a realistic portrayal of the sordid lives of criminals. Dickens' great novels always dealt with contemporary social evils and Oliver Twist is no exception. In the case of Oliver Twist the workhouse where poor children were sent to live, child labour, and the recruitment of children by criminals. This story is about the criminal under class in London in the 19th century, the inadequate way in which Victorian society cared for the children of the poor, and the contest between good and evil. It challenges the Victorian idea that the environment in which a child is raised will have no influence on the adult that child becomes. Dickens challenges the belief that paupers are lazy and criminals are evil when they are born. Dickens contends that vice is caused by a corrupt environment while there are some, like Oliver, who are incorruptable. Dickens considered charity in the Victorian England to be a failure. It was, like the work house in which Oliver lived, an opportunity for the rich and middle classes to live well at the expense of the poor. The Poor Law of 1834 permitted the indigent to receive government aid only if they lived in government workhouses. The workhouses were, in effect, slave labor camps. Children were required to work, families were almost always separated, and the food and clothing were meager. If the conditions at the poor houses were unpleasant, all the better. The poor would have more incentive to leave and get to work. However, workhouses did not typically provide any education or training to help the inmates better themselves and economic conditions (primarily dislocations from the industrial revolution) often made it difficult to find employment. In the story crafted by Dickens, everyone eventually receives their just reward, except for Nancy, who is a classic victim of spousal abuse. Oliver is saved by the power of charity and love even though it is only a few of the many people that he meets who do not try to use him or seduce him into the criminal side of life. Fagin is hanged. The Artful Dodger is transported to Australia. The charity and love exhibited by Oliver's saviors is contrasted with the fake charity of Fagin who pretends to look out for Oliver and the other children who have fallen under his influence. In fact, he is using them as soldiers of his criminal enterprise.",Oliver Twist,277,B000C20VU0

Objectives/Student Outcomes Using this Learning Guide: Through discussion, analysis of poetry, and writing, students will exercise important ELA skills relating to a gripping story. Students can become aware of differences in presentation between the novel and the film. The lessons of the story assist adolescents in resolving some of the social and emotional issues of growing up in modern society. Possible Problems:     Serious. As in the book, the movie is set against a violent backdrop in which fights are the preferred method of resolving conflict. One character is stabbed to death, another dies from being burned badly in a fire, and yet another provokes the police into shooting him to death. There is also mild profanity and scenes of teenagers drinking and smoking. Girls are sexually harassed. There is some talk about smoking marijuana.",The Outsiders,279,B000CEXEWA

One of the men to be hanged derides the posse for its haste and unwillingness to be fair with the epithet that they are not ""white men."" Equating lynching with blacks is a backhanded, but ironic, racial slur. At the end of the film, the leader of the posse goes into a room off-camera. We hear the sound of a gunshot as he commits suicide. Each of these issues can lead to an interesting discussion. See Discussion Questions below. Parenting Points:     Immediately after the movie, or at odd times over the next week (for example at the dinner table or in the car on the way to school) bring up the subject of the movie and comment that justice is one of the most basic human rights.

", ,,," Students will be able to place the concept of ""parallel universes"" in its context within Physics. However it may spark students' interest in parallel universes and in reading more about them. ","SNIPPET LESSON PLAN FOR: Parallel Universes Using Film Clips from The One Subject:     Science/Physics — Parallel Universes Ages:   12+; Middle School to High School Length:      Film Clips: two clips of less than 11 minutes. Learner Outcomes/Objectives:     Students will be able to place the concept of ""parallel universes"" in its context within Physics. However it may spark students' interest in parallel universes and in reading more about them. Rationale:     The One gives students dramatic visual images of the concept of parallel universes, imagining a way to travel from one to another. Many movies allude to parallel universes in one way or another. Movies like Frequency (2000) or the novel on which the movie Timeline (2003) is based include parallel universes that were similar to each other, the only difference being that one lags behind the other by a certain period of time. This produces some contradictions, as actions in one universe cannot have consequences in the history of the other. The movie The One (2001) does not use parallel universes as a tool for time-travel, it is staged on the basis of the existence of parallel universes and the possibility to travel from one to another. It therefor introduces the topic without getting into the distraction of time-travel and its contradictions. Description of the Snippet:     The first film clip superficially explains, in half a minute, the notion of parallel universes and posits a multiverse with 125 parallel universes each inhabited by a different version of the main character, Gabe Law. He has discovered that he gains for himself the strength and power of his doppelgangers if he kills them. In this multiverse it is a crime not only to murder, but also to travel between universes. The movie is set just before he attempts to kill the last of the 124 alterative versions of himself. In the second clip we see Mr. Law being arrested and sentenced to life in a prison located in a penal universe after he has murdered the 123rd version of himself. At the last moment he manages to escape to the universe where the 124th version of himself lives. Helpful Background:     Expressions like something happening ""in another universe"" have become common. This is partly the case because the concept has become more and more popular and relevant among scientists studying the cosmos and the main theories of Physics. Curiously the idea has arrived from various different and independent perspectives within Physics. One of these involves Quantum Theory. This theory is beyond the scope of K-12 education, but some basic ideas can easily be understood. For example, one of the principles of Quantum Physics is that every process has different possible outcomes and all of them have a probability of materializing. The most likely ones will happen most of the time the process takes place, but the less probable ones cannot be ruled out, every now and then they happen, too. Quantum Physics, however cannot predict which one will actually occur in any specific instance, it can only speak in terms of probability, stating that over a large number of occurrences, a certain proportion will result in one outcome and another proportion in a different one, and so on. A good example of this is radioactive decay: for a given radioactive material, Physics can predict how long it will take for half the available atoms to decay (half-life), but which atoms will decay at a certain point of time is impossible to predict. Many scientists, including Einstein in his time, have felt uncomfortable with this uncertainty, and are convinced that the reason for this is that Quantum Theory is incomplete, and that there must be a more complete alternative theory to be discovered that can actually establish the behavior of each single particle at every moment. One alternative theory is the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics proposed by Hugh Everett, which states that each time a process with different possible outcomes takes place, all of them actually happen. A whole new universe comes into being for each possible outcome and while in one universe one possible outcome materializes, in another the process results in a different one. In the example of radioactive decay, if we were following one single atom that may or may not decay in the next second, every second two universes would unfold, and the particle would decay in one of them and not decay in the other. Everything else in those two universes would be the same, and only from that point on will their histories drift apart, in accordance with the different consequences of the different outcomes. This really sounds crazy, just imagine how many universes this theory is placing out there. As a result, this idea has been widely challenged and is not considered a realistic possibility by most scientists. However, the alternative of accepting that there is an intrinsic indeterminacy in nature is equally appalling to the proponents of the parallel universe interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. Another route through which the idea of multiple universes has made it into the scientific domain is the need of Cosmology to explain certain characteristics of the universe that are related to the early stages of its evolution. In order to explain some properties of the universe (which we cannot go into here), cosmologists needed to postulate a particular phase of rapid expansion in the early universe. This phase is called inflation and consists of an extremely fast expansion, through which certain areas of the universe were left disconnected from others, at distances from each other such that not even light at its incredible speed could have travelled to them since the universe began. These disconnected areas are then labelled as parallel universes. It could be argued that strictly speaking they are not other universes, as they did originate from the same initial physical reality which was all that existed at the time. The word universe means, after all, ""all there is"", so if we stretch this definition, the existence of multiple universes would be in itself a contradiction. In fact, in this context the word universe is replaced by ""Multiverse"", to designate the broader reality in which the various parallel universes exist, so it may just be a matter of using the right words. A further context in which multiple universes appeared in science is String Theory. String Theory is closely related to Quantum Theory and is equally beyond the scope of K-12 education. For the purpose of this lesson plan let it suffice to explain that String Theory postulates many more dimensions than the three spatial dimensions plus time we are used to in our everyday lives. So, just as one can think of several two-dimensional structures (e.g. sheets) stacked beside each other in a three-dimensional space, String Theory states that our three-dimensional universe is just one of many three dimensional universes (membranes, or ""branes"" for short) stacked beside each other in a multiverse of more dimensions. Ideas like the Many World Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics and String Theory, need to be experimentally verified to be taken seriously in the scientific community. This is why those who are firmly convinced of their validity are working hard to make a prediction from the theory that can be verified by observation or experimentation. In the meantime they can be considered nice and elegant solutions to the problems they try to address, and provide an interesting basis from which science-fiction ideas may flourish. One only needs to imagine ways to communicate or travel from one parallel universe to another and the possibilities become infinite.",The One,281,B00005V1WW

Although in the novel by Ken Kesey, McMurphy manipulates the situation by organizing the outing and making a tidy profit for himself, in the film he simply absconds with a bus full of inmates, picks up his girlfriend and hijacks a fishing boat. The joyful energy spent catching the fish shows on the faces of the inmates; they have become happy, successful men rather than the troubled spirits they are at the hospital. Whether or not students read the book or see the entire movie, the snippet illustrates one of the film's ideas: society determines what is crazy and what is not crazy and this determination is created through observable behavior; in other words, crazy is as crazy does.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,282,

Rationale:     The film clips provide an excellent supplement to a unit on the spread of infectious disease. Description of the Snippet:     A deadly virus is transmitted from Africa to the United States and threatens to cause an epidemic. The clips are taken from the first hour of the movie showing how the disease spreads. Helpful Background:     THREATS TO HUMAN HEALTH PRESENTED BY VIRUSES When it was discovered that bacteria could cause disease, there were many illnesses for which bacterial agents could not be found. These included serious diseases such as smallpox, polio, rabies and influenza, as well as less serious maladies such as the common cold. These diseases, and many more, are caused by viruses. Viruses are infectious agents which are between 20 and 100 times smaller than bacteria. They are too small to be seen through a normal microscope and can be visualized only through an electron microscope. Viruses consist of strands of genetic material (RNA or DNA) surrounded by a coating of protein (called a capsid). Viruses are not considered to be living organisms because they cannot reproduce outside of a living cell. A virus binds to a cell when a part of the outer viral structure docks with a specific molecule on the cell surface. It then crosses the cell wall through a variety of methods (for example, injecting its genetic material through the cell wall or incorporating its capsid into the cell wall). Viruses multiply by inserting their genetic information into a cell and harnessing the cell machinery to replicate the viral genetic material and make new capsids. The new viruses are then transmitted to other cells, either through the cell wall or when the cells burst and die. Viruses are parasites on a cellular level. New strains of disease-causing viruses are a constant threat because viruses mutate easily. For example, each year a new influenza virus causes illness in millions of people. As a result, and because most drugs cannot disable a virus without harming healthy tissue, it is difficult to develop drug therapies to cure viral infections. Viruses can be transmitted from one animal species to another. They affect each species differently and one species can harbor viruses deadly to another without any ill effect. For example, most Ebola viruses and the Hanta virus, do not cause disease in their host animals, but they are deadly to man. The Ebola-Reston virus, on the other hand, is deadly to monkeys but does not cause illness in humans. Viral illnesses can be spread in a number of ways. Some, such as AIDS and Ebola, can only be spread through exchanges of blood or other bodily fluids. Others, such as influenza and the common cold, are airborne and enter through the respiratory tract. The Hanta virus is spread by breathing dried rodent feces which become airborne. The Ebola virus is in the shape of a long rod, usually 800 to 1000 nanometers long. (A nanometer is one billionth of a meter.) The virus consists of a coiled strand of ribonucleic acid (RNA) contained in an envelope derived from the host cell membrane. The envelope is covered with spikes that are used by the virus to gain entry to new host cells. There are several strains of Ebola virus of varying degrees of mortality. The most fatal is Ebola/Zaire which kills 88% of those infected. The virus is called ""Ebola"" because it was first discovered near the Ebola river in Zaire. Ebola hemorrhagic fever is characterized by severe headache, weakness and muscle aches, followed by abdominal pain, diarrhea, inflammation of the throat, eyes and mucous membranes, bleeding from body openings and destruction of internal organs. The incubation period is usually 5 to 10 days. The course of the disease is usually 7 to 10 days if it proves fatal. Between 12% and 50% of the victims will survive, depending on the strain of the virus. There is no known cure. In Zaire in 1995, blood from patients who were recovering was transfused into severely ill patients in an attempt to transfer antibodies to neutralize the virus. This technique met with some success; but clinical trials have yet to be conducted. Conventional treatment consists of preventing shock and providing supportive care. Care must be taken to prevent the spread of the illness to health care workers. Convalescence takes five weeks or more. The first identified outbreaks of Ebola occurred in 1976, one in Zaire and one in Sudan. There were about 550 cases and 430 deaths. Another outbreak occurred in the city of Kitwit, Zaire in 1995 affecting 315 people and killing 242. There have been isolated cases of Ebola in various places in Africa. Ebola spreads when a person becomes infected from an animal reservoir host and then spreads the disease to other humans. The host and natural transmission cycle for the Ebola virus remains unknown. There are historic precedents for many of the events described in the film. For example, neither smallpox nor the common cold existed in the Americas before the Europeans came. The indigenous population had not developed any genetic resistance to these viruses. Europeans brought these diseases with them, unintentionally causing pandemics which destroyed more than 3/4 of the population of some Native American tribes. It is believed by historians that the reason that the Spanish explorer Cortez, with only three hundred men, could conquer the massive and powerful Aztec empire was the spread of smallpox. In 1989, a deadly virus from Africa, the Lassa virus, was brought to the U.S. by a man who had traveled to Africa to attend the funerals of his parents, both of whom died from an illness thought to be caused by the Lassa virus. After the man flew home, he became ill, going to a suburban Chicago clinic complaining of fever and a sore throat. The doctors gave him antibiotics and sent him home where he died of Lassa fever. Fortunately, no one else became infected, partially because of improved sanitation precautions at the clinic imposed to restrict the spread of AIDS. There was also an outbreak of a strain of Ebola virus that was fatal to monkeys but fortunately not to humans at a primate quarantine facility in Reston, Virginia in 1989. For more on the Ebola virus and the illness that it causes, see CDC Fact Sheet on Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever and Ebola FAQ Hanta viruses infect vertebrates and are usually transmitted by dried rodent feces blown into the air as dust. Hanta viruses cause two different human diseases: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, in which damage to the kidneys is common, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, in which damage to the lungs is common. Hanta viruses were first identified in the Korean War when thousands of United Nations soldiers became ill with fever, headache and acute renal failure. Outbreaks in the American Southwest have been the most recent occurrences of Hanta virus infection. For more on the Hanta virus see All About Hanta Virus, a web page produced by the CDC.",Outbreak,283,B002GIBVVG

279,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/paw-project.html,"Description of the Movie: Dr. Jennifer Conrad is a young veterinarian practicing in California focusing on large exotic cats, many of whom are used in the film industry. She notices that cats, both exotic and domestic, are crippled by declawing. She helps develop a surgical procedure to repair some of the injury suffered by the big cats in her care. However, she soon realizes that 25% of the domestic cats in the U.S. are declawed and that surgery is much too expensive and time consuming to help all of them. She is joined by a few committed volunteers and they organize The Paw Project to campaign against declawing. Their first victory is getting the procedure banned in the City of West Hollywood. The citizen volunteers are surprised when lobbyists of the professional veterinary associations appear and oppose the ban. Apparently, the associations are protecting the interests of veterinarians who make money from the procedure. Through a series of legislative battles, Dr. Conrad and the volunteers of The Paw Project manage to get declawing banned in eight cities in California, including the major population centers of Los Angeles and San Francisco.","Rationale for the Lesson Plan: See note to teachers, above.",,Possible Problems: None.,"Objectives/Student Outcomes Using this Lesson Plan: Students will be shown a vivid example of how a few passionate individuals can influence public policy and lawmaking. They will have an increased understanding of the legislative process, the legal status of local government, the difference between law and regulation, the police power, and the dual role of ""professional associations"" concerned with the financial interests of their members while at the same time being responsible for fostering high standards of practice.

Age: 13+; MPAA Rating -- Not rated; TWM believes it would be rated as PG-13; Documentary; 2013, 58 minutes; Color. Available from The Paw Project Movie, Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, Netflix and others. Note to Teachers: The vast majority of students will not be active in politics as adults. Many will feel that they are too insignificant or powerless to make a difference. However, at some time in their lives an issue may become important to them. It is therefore helpful for students to know that a few committed people can bring about change in both public opinion and the law. The emotional driver for this lesson is an engaging film which shows citizens securing the passage of municipal ordinances to ban the declawing of cats in major cities across California. While not shown in the movie, these individuals have also influenced the passage of three state laws that limit declawing and the adoption of a federal policy prohibiting the declawing of wild and exotic cats. They continue to work to ban all declawing, but due to opposition by powerful national and state veterinary associations, they have not yet reached their goal. In the vast majority of U.S. and Canadian jurisdictions veterinarians can still make money declawing cats, a brutal procedure which involves the amputation of the last set of bones in each paw. The operation leaves animals disabled for life and subject to painful chronic infections in their feet. For many declawed cats, every step is a painful ordeal. This film is The Paw Project's educational and advocacy effort before the next round of legislative and regulatory battles. Thus, students who watch the movie will be in the interesting position of both studying and being the subject of The Paw Project's outreach and education efforts. They will experience a creative new way (the film itself) by which citizens are challenging strong and entrenched professional organizations. Because the issue is narrow and relatively simple, the legislative, regulatory and other documents relating to the controversy are within the ability of many high school students to read. They also happen to be relatively short and well-written. The emotion generated by the film will cause students to develop passionate opinions about the dispute, offering a unique opportunity for a motivated reading of documents generated by representative government.

Teachers are advised to obtain parental and administrative permission before showing this movie. See TWM's Movie Permission Slip. It is helpful to explain at least three things to a class that has watched this movie. First, when the actors in the film stood in the back of the pick-up truck, they were held in place with wires and many other off-screen precautions were taken to protect them. Second, marijuana, like many drugs, can have side effects, perhaps the most common is that frequent marijuana use can destroy motivation. Three, taking LSD sometimes causes people to do dangerous things and every once in a while they get hurt or they don't come back from the trip with a sound mind. Have students read the book first.

But Precious is valuable to Mary because Precious and Mongo, the Down Syndrome daughter to which Precious gave birth at age 12, increase the size of Mary's welfare check — although Mongo lives with Mary's mother, visiting only when the welfare worker comes to check on the family. That's really bad, but there's more to come. Precious' two pregnancies were the result of serial rapes by her father, tolerated but resented by Mary — not because Mary objects to incest — Mary resents the fact that Precious ""stole"" her man and that while he gave Mary only one child, he's given Precious two! Perhaps another cause of Mary's abuse of her daughter is repressed guilt that she did nothing to stop the abuse when it began — when Precious was three years old. But perhaps not; Mary isn't the type to feel guilt about anything.         Can it get worse? It does. The incestuous father gave Precious HIV. However, when Precious is sent to an alternative school and placed under the tutelage of a nurturing teacher named Blue Rain, Precious blossoms. She gets over the fact that Ms. Rain is a ""homo"", a group that Mary told her were dangerous, and starts learning to read. Precious gains self-respect, successfully delivers a healthy baby, escapes from Mary, and sets about the task of raising her children and getting an education. The film is based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Rationale for Using the Movie: This film provides insight into what it's like to be raised unloved, abused, and hopeless. It shows that with love and nurturing even children of the most dysfunctional families can move forward with their lives and attain a triumph of the human spirit. Showing this film and using the materials in the Learning Guide will increase understanding of the scourge of childhood sexual abuse. (CDC estimates are that about 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6 boys will be victims of childhood sexual abuse.) The story also provides graphic depictions of the psychological defense mechanism of dissociation. Objectives/Student Outcomes Using this Learning Guide: Watching this film with the scaffolding suggested by the Learning Guide will increase resilience in children subject to dysfunctional families and to sexual and physical abuse. In children who do not have to contend with those problems, the movie will expand empathy for those who are not so fortunate. As Gabourey Sidibe, the college student who played the lead role said, I know this girl. . . . I've seen her, I've lived beside this girl. . . . I didn't want to be friends with those girls because they had too much drama going on in their lives. I feel guilty for having ignored them."" (Interview with Roger Ebert). The intense emotions raised by this film will drive writing assignments for the development of skills required by the ELA curriculum. Possible Problems:     Serious. One incident of the incest/rape of a child and another of a woman masturbating are shown; however, the scenes are not graphic. Repeated instances of physical abuse of a child by her mother are shown. The film is shot through with profanity. The primary problem is the movie's great strength: the issues raised by this film are very disturbing. However, they need to be addressed.",Precious,294,B002VECM4A

Less extreme violence would have been preferable, however, there are five reasons why we recommend this film despite the violence. First, this is animation. Children have watched cartoon characters kill, maim and destroy each other for generations without ill effect. Second, the violence occurs through the agency of Ashitaka's arm, which not only suffers from the curse of the boar god but, when Ashitaka is provoked, has a god-like strength. It is not the character of Ashitaka who commits the violence, it's the evil that has taken control of his arm. Third, the animation is set in a dim and mythical past and these are not real people. Fourth, we recommend this film for children twelve and up. By that age, unfortunately, most children have seen so much violence in movies and on television that they won't be affected by the cartoon violence in this film.

Harmonic Motion, Waves; Ages:    10+; Late Elementary to High School Length:      Film Clips: Pirates of the Caribbean ? At World's End: three minutes 30 seconds; Tacoma Bridge Collapse Video on YouTube: four minutes 13 seconds. Lesson: Playing the snippets and discussing the examples of harmonic motion described in the Helpful Background section will take about 40 minutes. Learner Outcomes/Objectives:     Students will learn about resonance and be able to recognize it in everyday occurrences. Rationale:     The sequence from the film Pirates of the Caribbean ? At World's End offers a spectacular fictional example of the use of resonance to tip over an entire pirate ship. This allows teachers to introduce or review this concept from physics and relate it to real-life examples, including the Tacoma Bridge Collapse of 1940. Resonance is also an interesting way to introduce harmonic motion and concepts such as amplitude and frequency. Description of the Film Clips:    Jack Sparrow and the rest of the crew of the ship known as the Black Pearl try to follow a map with cryptic instructions. Jack Sparrow suddenly realizes that they need to tip the ship over. He gets his shipmates to join an effort to rock the ship by running back and forth from port to starboard at the exact regular intervals that amplify the oscillation until the ship capsizes. A dramatic real life instance of resonance is the famous Tacoma Bridge collapse of 1940. This film clip on YouTube shows footage from before and during the collapse of the bridge. Helpful Background:     Resonance is a phenomenon that can occur in association with any movement that repeats itself at regular intervals. Examples are vibrations, oscillations, waves, and motion in closed trajectories, such as circles. These are all instances of harmonic motion. Without knowing of the term ""resonance"" or its underlying physics, people have a sense of what constitutes harmonic motion. When children play on a swing (which is essentially a pendulum with a seat for a child), they instinctively know when to give the swing added momentum by moving their hanging legs forwards or backwards and tipping their bodies in the opposite direction. When a parent or a friend pushes a child on a swing, they also intuitively know that a slight push will have most effect if given immediately after the apogee of the swinging motion. As the swing moves further, the extremes of its trajectory are further apart. The distance between the extremes of a pendulum is called its amplitude. But, does a child in a swing or a weight at the end of a pendulum move back and forth at shorter time intervals when given an impulse at the top of the swing, just as the motion reverses and begins to go down? Try it out, either with a real swing in the schoolyard or using any simple ""model to scale"" pendulum made with a weight attached to the end of a string. Measure how often the child or the weight passes through a given position, for example one extreme of its trajectory. How often the weight at the end of the pendulum (or the child on the swing) passes through this point over a fixed period of time is called the frequency of the oscillation. Comparing the frequency of the swing/pendulum for a ""small"" oscillation (small amplitude) with that of a ""big"" oscillation (large amplitude), shows that regardless of the amplitude of the oscillation, the frequency of the pendulum is always the same for a given swing/child or string/weight combination. This is called the natural frequency of the pendulum's oscillation. Given a specific swing or length of string on a pendulum, frequency does not vary with changes in the distance covered by the oscillating motion. But if we increase the distance covered by the oscillating motion, the child on a swing or the weight on a pendulum has to travel a longer distance in the same time (the time it takes it to get back to one extreme of the oscillation). In other words, the child/weight will have a larger average speed in each longer oscillation. The speed is always zero at the extremes of the trajectory because the child/weight has to stop and reverse direction. The child/weight achieves the maximum speed in its motion between the extremes when it passes the lowest point of its trajectory. So, it is in this sense, and not in that of the frequency, that a swing, or any sort of pendulum, will go faster when pushed correctly. To summarize, by giving a pendulum impulses at the right moments, the amplitude of its oscillation and the speed of the dangling object can be increased. We are not able, however, to influence the frequency of its oscillation. This frequency is fixed by other factors, namely by the length of the swing and its mass (weight). This can be shown by trying the experiment with shorter swings or heavier weights. Now consider ""the right moments"" to apply the impulses, i.e. the pushes. Watch a parent pushing a child on a swing. The pushing of the swing is a periodic action to which a frequency can be ascribed (""how often"" the pushing force is applied). Measure the frequency of the oscillation and also the frequency of the impulses. You will find that both frequencies are equal if in fact the impulses are contributing towards a larger oscillation, that is, if pushing and swinging are in resonance. If one looks closely, resonance is all around us. 1. The sound of the vibrating parts of musical instruments is amplified through resonance. See Resonance and Musical Instruments. Every time a sound is emitted, something vibrates. The oscillating motion of the vibrating objects is transferred to adjacent air molecules, which in turn bump their neighboring molecules into the oscillating motion. A wave is therefore a set of molecules oscillating in sequence about their position a rest. This can be simulated with a simple device. See Gummy Bear Wave Machine-2. Air molecules are represented by the Gummi Bears. It can be seen that each oscillating molecule (Gummy Bear) considered individually behaves like a harmonic oscillator. A wave is then formed when all adjacent molecules swing this way in an ordered sequence. Humans have made use of controlled sound since very early times, developing what is called music. The vibrating part of a musical instrument is sometimes obvious, as in a guitar or a piano, and sometimes less so, as in most wind instruments. In fact, in most of the wind instruments the vibrating parts are the players' lips! In any case, if the only sound was made directly by the vibrating element, the sound could be heard only from very short distances. In an auditorium, only the first rows would be able to hear its sound. For the sound to be reasonably loud, instruments have what is known as resonance chamber, which in fact makes up the main ""body"" of the instrument. It is so shaped that there is always one direction in which the wave from the sound that is being played gets ""trapped"" bouncing back and forth in a manner that waves travelling in one direction overlap with those travelling in the opposite direction, forming a resonating standing wave. Watch the following animation to see the resulting standing wave (top) from the combination of two equal waves travelling in opposite directions (middle and bottom) Standing Wave Demo 1. Feedback frequently occurs when a microphone is placed near a loudspeaker to which it is connected. This is due to resonance. When the microphone picks up sound, it sends a particular set of sound waves—encoded as electrical signals—to the electronic amplifier. The amplifier in turn feeds the loudspeakers with the same set of sound waves, except that their amplitude is larger. If this amplified sound reaches the microphone again while the original sound is still being emitted by its source, it will superimpose itself on the original sound, boosting the very same wavelengths, which will be amplified further. (Note that this usually does not happen with human speech, as a different sound is being pronounced by the time the amplified waves reach the microphone, and no boosting occurs. It is usually a tiny background hum or noise that sets off the feedback.) This becomes a loop in which loudness increases up to the speaker's limits until someone breaks it by putting a hand over the microphone or disconnects it, or the loudspeakers are turned away from the microphone. See How to Eliminate Feedback. 2. Resonance is also the way microwave ovens work, as the water content of food is heated by making water molecules vibrate at their natural frequency. To understand this we need to bear in mind that the concept of ""temperature"" is nothing else than a measure of the kinetic energy of the molecules: the energy they have because of their motion. Hot stuff has faster molecules that have more energy than the slow ones of cold stuff. The energy of the kitchen fire when heating up food goes into the motion of the molecules. Molecules can move in many ways and vibrating is one of them. They can vibrate in various natural frequencies, also called modes of oscillation. So, why not push them into vibrating in one of those modes directly, instead of supplying heat and waiting for them to get moving? This is what microwave ovens do: food is irradiated with radio waves whose frequency corresponds to one natural frequency of water molecules. (Water being the main component of organic matter, such as food.) Resonance between those radio waves (microwaves) and the molecules sets them off into oscillation. The energy is transferred from the radiation to the molecules: the food is heated. 3. When an old car starts clattering when reaching a particular speed, this is because the vibrations of the engine get into resonance with the natural frequencies of loose parts.",Harmonic Motion,301,B00005JPFX

Helpful Background:     Light travels in a straight line and at a given speed through any medium, be it in vacuum, air, water or glass. When light passes from one medium to another, however, light waves are deflected if they hit the boundary between the two media at an oblique angle. This occurs because the speed of light in one medium is different than its speed in the other. As a result, a spoon sticking out of a glass of water appears bent to the human eye. See the ""Reflection and Refraction"" section of Many Faces of Light: As Newton Saw it, with Some Magic Tricks. Not only does the speed of light change when it goes through different media, it changes when the physical properties of a medium change. When the change in the medium is gradual, occurring over a long distances, the refraction occurs little by little. Light rays do not bend abruptly at one point but end up describing a curved path. This explains the formation of mirages where air is very hot near the ground, as in deserts or on asphalt. The bending of light rays will cause objects to look farther away or closer than they really are. In the science of optics a mirage is defined as ""an optical illusion caused by atmospheric conditions."" The most frequent mirage effect seen by most people is in the image of the sun when it is low in the sky at sunrise and sunset. For rays from the sun to reach the surface of the earth they must pass through the atmosphere, where pressure and temperature conditions change gradually from the uppermost layers to the ground level. This changes the speed with which light from the sun passes through the layers of air and bends the rays of sunlight. When the path through the atmosphere is longer, the bending of the rays is larger and the displacement of the image of the sun from its true position caused by the mirage effect is greater. Due to this effect, the sun can often still be seen when its true position is below the horizon. See The Formation of a Mirage and ""Atmospheric Refraction"" in Our View of the Sky. An interactive application showing the true and apparent position of the sun over the horizon depending upon altitude, atmospheric pressure, and temperature can be accessed at Atmospheric Refraction Applet — Apparent Flattening of the Sun. Refraction within a medium not only depends upon pressure and temperature, it also depends on the wavelength (color) of the light. This occurs because different colors are refracted differently. Click here for a graphic representation of the refraction of white light into its various colors. The different refractions of the various colors within sunlight results in the appearance of different ""solar discs"", one for each color of the rainbow. The blue, violet and green light from the sun refracts so that the disc-images of these colors are slightly higher than the yellow disc, which is the brightest of them all. The blue, violet and green discs are normally not distinguishable for several reasons. During most of the day, the yellow disc outshines the others. However, at sunrise or sunset, when light from the sun must pass through the maximum amount of atmosphere to reach the viewer, that is, when refraction is at its greatest and the strength of the yellow disc has dimmed, the opportunity to see the differently colored disc-images is at its height. But still, the discs are not clearly apparent. The violet and blue discs are those refracted most, and therefore the last to set on the horizon. However, blue light is dispersed away in the atmosphere (this is why the sky is blue in daylight) and leaves the blue image of the solar disc very weak, if visible at all. The violet disc is usually very weak as well and it is therefore difficult to distinguish. This leaves the green disc being the last to set but the power of the yellow disk is still very strong and the green disc can be seen only in the fleeting instant in which the yellow disc has already set and the last part of the green disc appears above the horizon. This is what is called the green flash. The term ""flash"" is not very appropriate, as it raises expectations for a bright flash of light. It also probably influenced the filmmakers of Pirates of the Caribbean into depicting it as such. A great collection of images of the green flash in some of its manifestations can be seen at: Green Flash. Note that the subsequent pages of this site can be accessed by clicking on the arrows in the upper right corner of the website. The gallery includes photographs taken with exceptional atmospheric and visibility conditions that favor the viewing of even the blue and violet discs. For additional websites showing visuals of the green flash, see Wikipedia; Scientific Explorations and Earth Science: Picture of the Day. See also Green, blue and violet flashes. The displacement of the green (and blue and violet solar discs) is, of course, present well before the instant the sun disappears behind the horizon. That instant is a good moment to see them without the brighter yellow disc outshining them. However, a photographic or video recording of the setting sun can show, when viewed close-up and slowed down, that the green disc becomes visible amidst the turbulent image of the setting sun even while the sun is above the horizon. Watch it in seconds 21 to 30 of a beautiful video on the sky of the island of Tenerife, Spain: Canary Sky - Tenerife. Be sure to caution students: Take care of your eyes.

In conjunction with ","MINOR. Absent from this film is an acknowledgment of the hour upon hour of grueling work in technique classes required of a ballet dancer. (This is more clearly seen in The Turning Point and Dancemaker.) The plot of ""The Red Shoes"" is based on the assumption that a woman must choose between a dance career and a fulfilling personal life. As modern prima ballerinas have demonstrated, this is no longer true. Like professional athletes, ballet dancers peak physically in their twenties. Many end their stage careers before the age of forty, leaving them in step with non-dancing contemporaries who have delayed childbearing for their careers. Some ballerinas have been able to have children during their careers. The film ends tragically. Parenting Points:     Before watching the film briefly review with your child the history of the Ballet Russe and the remarkable character of Sergei Diaghilev. See the Helpful Background section. Immediately after the movie ask and help your child to answer the Quick Discussion Question.

314,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/roxanne.html,"Steve Martin's ""Roxanne"" is a delightful comedic reworking of Cyrano de Bergerac, the 1897 classic play. In both incarnations the story's value lies in its presentation of the conflict between style and substance: the fact that the outward appearance of an individual often masks what lies inside. Charlie D. Bales, initials C.D.B, is a man with a huge nose. He appears to be blustery and brash, yet inside he is sensitive, intelligent, and caring. In addition, Charlie can use words beautifully. Chris, on the other hand, is handsome to the extreme, yet shallow and dull. Roxanne is initially attracted to Chris' beauty but she quickly falls in love when Charlie writes and speaks for the other man. Ultimately, the deception fails, however, in a departure from the original, everyone lives happily ever after. An interesting aspect of ""Roxanne"", which varies considerably from the play, is the development of the female lead.

Description:     Steve Martin's ""Roxanne"" is a delightful comedic reworking of Cyrano de Bergerac, the 1897 classic play. In both incarnations the story's value lies in its presentation of the conflict between style and substance: the fact that the outward appearance of an individual often masks what lies inside. Charlie D. Bales, initials C.D.B, is a man with a huge nose. He appears to be blustery and brash, yet inside he is sensitive, intelligent, and caring. In addition, Charlie can use words beautifully. Chris, on the other hand, is handsome to the extreme, yet shallow and dull. Roxanne is initially attracted to Chris' beauty but she quickly falls in love when Charlie writes and speaks for the other man. Ultimately, the deception fails, however, in a departure from the original, everyone lives happily ever after. An interesting aspect of ""Roxanne"", which varies considerably from the play, is the development of the female lead. The original Roxanne is beautiful, but lacks depth; she is an object rather than a subject. In Martins remake, Roxanne is an intelligent woman, working on her doctorate in astronomy.

Learner Outcomes/Objectives:     These film clips and the ensuing discussion and assignment will provide students with an interesting change of pace in studying virology and the speed of evolution. Rationale:     Different aspects of life sciences are used in movies like The Relic to give events in the story a scientific framework and increased credibility. In The Relic, scientists put the existence of a monstrous creature into the context of DNA alterations through a virus, the ingestion of genetically modified nutrients, and a new wrinkle in the theory of evolution. Their hypotheses are completely fictitious, but the errors provide a context for learning the real scientific understanding of virus and the pace of evolution. Description of the Snippet:     A monster runs amok in the Natural History Museum of Chicago when the museum is about to open a new exhibition. The creature seems to be connected to some crates sent to the museum by a scientist doing field work in a remote South American jungle. The crates are crammed with leaves containing a parasitic fungus. Even the ship that carried the crates from South America has become the scene of vicious attacks by the monster. But the monster is too big to have arrived in the crates and scientists at the museum are looking for an explanation. The scientists in the movie hypothesize that the creature started as a normal being but was changed into this monstrous state by eating infested leaves from the crates. They claim that the virus would have inserted its own DNA to the cells of the plant and that in turn take over the DNA of any animal that eats it. However this altered DNA seems to be coding reptilian hormones and, in fact, turns out to be reptilian DNA altogether. As confirmation of their theory, the scientists point to the case of a small beetle that accidentally ate from the same leaves and in matter of days became a bug the size of a small cat. Segment 1 shows the scientists, Margo and Dr. Frock, commenting on this after a DNA analysis reveals that the giant bug has reptilian DNA in it. In the second film clip, the scientists describe their thoughts to a detective who is investigating the case. Dr. Frock relates their theory on the monster to a hypothesis about evolution called the Callisto Effect, for which he is seeking proof. The Callisto Effect is entirely fictitious and postulates that evolution can lead to a predator with extraordinary powers that is so strong and voracious that it causes the extinction of other species before dying out itself. Helpful Background:     Viruses and DNA Rewriting It is true that some viruses have developed the ability to replace DNA segments of the infected cells in their effort to use the host cell for their own reproduction. In fact, this ability of viruses is being studied for its therapeutic uses by medical researchers in what is called ""gene therapy"": What is Gene Therapy from Wisegeek.com. However, viruses would not sporadically insert DNA of a third kind of organism; they use their ability to rewrite DNA to introduce their own genetic information, to have the cells build replicas of the virus. So, unless someone deliberately programmed some viruses to rewrite the plant's DNA with reptilian features as is done in gene therapy, the first part of the theory of the scientists in The Relic is not realistic at all. The hijacking of the replicating mechanism of other organisms in order to reproduce is the very essence of a virus. This is why viruses are considered to be on the borderline between living and non-living things: if the ability to reproduce is part of what we understand as life, can something be considered life if it only is able to reproduce through the cells of others? Learn more about this debate at Are Viruses Alive from Microbial Life Educational Resources. Acquiring New Genetic Information Through DNA Ingestion Second, even if reptilian features somehow found their way into the plant's DNA, there is no way that an animal eating these leaves with altered DNA could evolve into a reptile-like-creature: DNA is not acquired and replaced by eating cells with different DNA. If that were so, we would end up becoming what we eat. However, Dr. Frock in The Relic clearly states in the second film clip that by ingesting such leaves any animal would experience a DNA alteration. He believes that the tribe of the Zanzera used this in order to create monstrous creatures to fight their enemies. The belief that DNA, or parts of it can be acquired by eating it is behind some of the objections against the use of genetically altered foods. People making this objection assumed that our normal DNA is somehow related to eating food as provided by nature and that ingesting altered DNA could alter our own genetic code. But there is a justified concern about genetically altered food: if some DNA segments have been altered to improve the plant, the change may cause some other unforeseen effects in the plants. Our still limited knowledge of genetics does not allow us to be sure before the change has been tried. However, genetically altered food is not allowed into the market unless it has been thoroughly tested for unexpected side effects. Regulations are strict and regulators tend to stay on the safe side when in doubt. On the other hand, mankind has been genetically altering plants since agriculture was adopted as a means of providing food. Certain types of plants were favored to obtain the seeds for the next sowing season. ""Natural"" wheat or corn is substantially smaller than that growing in modern fields. Also, animals have been genetically engineered since wolves were domesticated and bred to become something as different as a poodle or a Chihuahua. Chickens are bred to have enlarged meaty breasts that make them fall over if they ever get out of their tiny cages. Animal breeding has also been done by trial and error without the knowledge of possible unwanted collateral effects. See Understanding Evolution: Artificial Selection from Berkely.edu and Dog Breeds: An Example of Artificial Selection from Windows to the Universe. Mutations and Transformations Now, even if the altered DNA could somehow be transferred to an organism that ate it, in order to change the whole structure of the animal it would need to reach every cell of the specimen. Fully developed individuals have already built their bodies according to their genetic information, which is contained in each and every cell. Every cell has the whole instruction manual in it on how to build the body, even if a particular cell only needs to know the small part of this information that instructs it to become part of a particular organ. If a cell ends up with DNA which is different from its precursor cell, either through an error during replication, or an externally induced mutation, it will only behave abnormally if the alteration affects the part of the DNA that contains information specific to its function. And even in this case, only that particular cell, and those that will originate by its replication, will deviate from healthy development. This may cause a localized problem, like cancer (which can spread to other local sites by metastasis), but it will not cause a complete change in all the cells of the whole organism. In order to affect a whole individual, mutations would need to occur in the gametes of its parent individuals or, at most, immediately after fertilization of the egg, when there is only one cell that will be the model for all other cells. The Pace of Evolution In The Relic, Dr. Frock claims that the Zanzera tribe's way of inducing the development of a monster by feeding infected leaves to a normal animal is proof that the ""Callisto Effect"" is possible. According to this theory, which exists only in the fiction of The Relic, random mutations should be able to induce sudden major changes in some organisms, creating short-lived creatures that are very different from their immediate ancestors. This ""Callisto Effect"" is a completely fictitious theory, but it is based on an issue that is still today under debate among experts in evolution. It is the question of whether evolution tends to occur slowly and steadily or in sudden jumps. As in every field of science, to test such a question, hypotheses are formulated and their predictions compared to observation. This process is explained as applied to the question of the pace of evolution in The pace of evolution from Berkely.edu. See also the Helpful Background of the TWM Snippet Lesson Plan for Evolution Using H. G. Wells' The Time Machine which discusses and provides links to sites relating to the speed of evolution in blue moths and fish; the ability of human adults to digest milk; and the appearance of blue eyes in human beings.",Viruses and the Speed of Evolution Using The Relic,326,B000USU9DK

Rationale:     Robots are ubiquitous in movies set in the future. Often they are just part of the futuristic backdrop for the story and even when they play a part, they are usually not the focus of the issues addressed by the film. The implications of artificial intelligence and the possibility that robots will gain autonomy and independence from their creators have sparked countless analogies with the story of the creation and the evolution of humankind. A recurring theme is that robots will develop a dignity of their own and that they will begin to have relationship with humans (Blade Runner; A.I.; I, robot). Most of these films depict scenarios set in distant futures and therefore imaginary realities. However, the fact is that robots are becoming more and more intelligent presenting ethical and moral issues that will need to be addressed relatively soon. The movie Robot and Frank provides a unique opportunity for this, as it is set in a very near future, where the events taking place are relatable (such as a whole library switching to electronic publications, keeping just a few ""real"" books as relics of the past) and life is not very different from the present. This highlights aspects related to robot ethics that are already now in need of a closer consideration by students. Description of the Film Clips:     Although reluctantly, Frank has finally accepted the Robot's company in his life. As we see in Clip # 1 the Robot's mission is to keep Frank healthy, and it would be subject to a memory wipe and reprogramming if it failed. Frank starts to even like the Robot when he discovers that he can use it as an accomplice in his burglaries. Clip # 2 shows how Frank discovers that the Robot would actually be able to assist him.

Clip # 4 shows how attached Frank has finally gotten to the Robot and that he is saddened by having to push its ""reset"" button. Helpful Background:     A rebellion of robots against humans and/or the point at which artificial intelligence surpasses that of humans (The Singularity) will undoubtedly bring to the fore important ethical and legal issues, some of which are already being explored in universities, science-fiction novels, and movies. And although there are scholars that are seriously studying this field and preparing for the Singularity, it is commonly mis-perceived as something in the distant future that is hardly relevant in the present. However, most experts estimate that AI will surpass that of humans within 40 years; some believe it will happen in less than ten years. However, the use and potential abuse of robots is already taking place at state of the art robotics and AI laboratories. Committees and boards are being set up in different countries and internationally to start dealing with these issues. As this is a relatively new field, there are many different approaches. We will use here the ideas of Alan Winfield, Professor of Electronic Engineering at the University of the West of England and the Bristol Robotics Laboratory. Prof. Winfield raises four main areas of concern that affect currently operative robots that are in use in the present. One concern is that of the responsibility for a robot's actions. If a robot causes harm due to a malfunction or a wrong decision taken autonomously who is to take the blame and be made to bear the consequences, such as legal liability? Is it the owner, or the designer, or the seller or all three? What safety and insurance regulations are necessary? In Robot and Frank the robot decides to help Frank in the preparation of his burglaries and in hiding the stolen jewels. Should it be treated as an accomplice or should the manufacturer be liable? In the movie we can also see that the robot would face a memory wipe and reprogramming if it failed to achieve its purpose of keeping Frank healthy. Would that suffice as a ""punishment""? Is anyone actually being ""punished"" at all in this way? Another concern is, naturally the weaponization of robots. The use of robots to make decisions about whether to attack and kill humans poses a whole range of ethical and legal problems, beyond the natural repulsion that any killing produces. For example, if no human actually makes the decision to pull the trigger, killing people will become easier and easier, and no one will feel responsible. Or, the question of how robots will be made to comply with ethics and law when designed and used to cause harm or to kill. In a less violent manner, this problem is represented in Robot and Frank by the use Frank makes of the robot's skill to pick locks and help him in his burglaries. A third concern focuses on the deception that takes place when robots look like humans and become indistinguishable from them. See Most_Realistic_Android_Ever. Is it ethical to allow that such robots exist and to keep humans in the dark about whom they are talking to, believing, trusting, or even taking orders from? There are several movies that deal with this kind of deception, like Sim0ne (2002), The Stepford Wives (2004), or Screamers (1995). But in reality there are already several very human-looking robots around and this raises another whole set of concerns for the future of robotics and its limits. The robot in Robot and Frank is not deceptive at all, but this issue is also hinted at when it ends up unwillingly ""deceiving"" Frank into thinking it is a unique self-conscious being with an identity. In fact it is ironic that it is the robot itself who tries to convince Frank otherwise when Frank refuses to wipe its memory to erase any proof of his own participation in the robbery. A fourth concern is related to a tendency that is often seen in movies involving robots, the anthropomorphizing of robots and the emotional bond that follows. In fact, often robots do not even have to look like humans or pets to raise feelings that real humans or animals do. Does this make us particularly vulnerable to abuse through robots? Is this bonding dangerous and differently so from what usually happens with animal pets? There are already pet robots or medical aid robots that in a very limited manner accompany humans throughout a great part of their lives. Is the attachment they harness, usually from vulnerable humans, a healthy relationship we should get used to in the future or something to avoid? A visit to the websites of research institutions on robotics can give a more accurate picture of the state of the art. See, for example, Bristol Robotics Laboratory University of Southern California Robotics Research Lab and Stanford AI Lab Note the Assisted Living page from the Bristol Robotics Laboratory which states, ""A robot as the interface also has the potential to offer a more social and entertaining interaction experience."" In other words, scientists are working right now on developing the type of robot shown in the movie.",Robot Ethics,327,B00AENNHOE

The additional materials provided by this Learning Guide will enhance student understanding of the era and of the roles of Dr. King and LBJ in the passage of th 1965 Voting Rights Act.,"LEARNING GUIDE FOR: SELMA Warning to teachers: Historically speaking, Selma is a deeply flawed movie. It misrepresents the extraordinary role played by President Lyndon Baines Johnson (""LBJ"") in developing and passing the 1965 Voting Rights Act and falsely claims that LBJ was complicit in the FBI's attempts to sow marital discord between Dr. King and his wife. The purpose of the director/ screenwriter was apparently to provide a clear villain for the plot and because as she said, ""I wasn't interested in making a white-savior movie."" These errors undercut some of the great strengths of the film in its largely accurate description of the Selma protests and its nuanced portrayal of Dr. King. For teachers who want to use the film, this Learning Guide will assist in correcting for its flaws and in maximizing its benefits. In addition, the Guide contains materials to enhance classes in the Civil Rights Movement and U.S. history of the 1950s and 1960s. These materials will be helpful to students whether or not they watch the movie. They include the following: LBJ grew from a typical Southern politician who consistently opposed civil rights laws to the person who did more for racial equality than any other 20th century white leader. LBJ's odyssey is an example of the power of nonviolent direct action to use the conscience and self-interest of the members of an oppressor group's power elite to induce them to change their position and to enthusiastically work for reform. The relationship between MLK and LBJ was extraordinary because it involved cooperation between the most powerful official of a country and a social activist in which they worked together to secure major social and political reform. A more important story than the tale of Dr. King's extramarital sexual activities is the abuse of power by the FBI, which went far beyond the agency's proper role when it wiretapped Dr. King and his associates, presented selective and misleading evidence to its superiors, leaked derogatory information about Dr. King to the press and others, and engaged in unauthorized covert activities to ""neutralize"" Dr. King as an African American leader. While LBJ may have condoned some of the leaks of derogatory information about Dr. King, he was not responsible for any of the FBI's covert activities targeting MLK. However, LBJ committed a grave error when he allowed the FBI to collect information on the political activities of Dr. King and other civil rights activists and used that information for his own political advantage. None of the many journalists, politicians, and clergy who were offered the details of Dr. King's extramarital sex life, took the FBI's bait and used the information against Dr. King or the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The result would probably be very different today. Dr. King's extramarital sexual relations were unwise, hypocritical, and regrettable. They put at risk the entire Civil Rights Movement and the Kennedy/Johnson legislative program which was designed to correct civil rights abuses. Fortunately, scandal did not overtake Dr. King. His contribution to American society was so great that these lapses pale in comparison. The Learning Guide contains information, discussion questions, and assignments on the points set out above and introduces two Alabama public figures, also shown in the movie, who played important roles in the Selma protests: Alabama Governor George C. Wallace and U.S. District Judge Frank M. Johnson.

The President has signed a treaty with the Soviet Union requiring both countries to destroy their nuclear weapons. The polls show the treaty to be unpopular. The charismatic Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff believes that the Soviets will cheat and launch a nuclear surprise attack which would kill hundreds of millions and destroy the United States. He is a man of action .... The plot of this film is not as wild as it seems at first glance. There have been times when the military establishment disagreed strongly with the policy of the President. On at least one occasion, a high ranking military officer defied the Commander in Chief. Douglas MacArthur commanded U.S. troops during the Korean War and was a very popular figure in the U.S. MacArthur sought to expand the conflict to China at the same time that President Truman, intent on avoiding WWIII, worked to limit the scope of the war. Truman promptly fired MacArthur, reasserting civilian control over the military. Another documented occasion of disagreement was during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1962 the Soviet Union secretly placed nuclear missiles in Cuba. President Kennedy required the U.S. government to respond in a measured way and did everything he could to avoid nuclear war. The situation was so tense that one misstep could have caused a general war. Many elements in the U.S. military thought that Kennedy was not being aggressive enough. They thought his policy was poor, almost suicidal. They strongly advocated steps that would have led to a general war. Fortunately, on this occasion the military obeyed the Commander in Chief (the President). See Learning Guide to ""Thirteen Days"", which presents the conflict in a somewhat exaggerated fashion.

On at least one occasion, a high ranking military officer defied the Commander in Chief. Douglas MacArthur commanded U.S. troops during the Korean War and was a very popular figure in the U.S. MacArthur sought to expand the conflict to China at the same time that President Truman, intent on avoiding WWIII, worked to limit the scope of the war. Truman promptly fired MacArthur, reasserting civilian control over the military. Another documented occasion of disagreement was during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1962 the Soviet Union secretly placed nuclear missiles in Cuba. President Kennedy required the U.S. government to respond in a measured way and did everything he could to avoid nuclear war. The situation was so tense that one misstep could have caused a general war. Many elements in the U.S. military thought that Kennedy was not being aggressive enough. They thought his policy was poor, almost suicidal. They strongly advocated steps that would have led to a general war. Fortunately, on this occasion the military obeyed the Commander in Chief (the President). See Learning Guide to ""Thirteen Days"", which presents the conflict in a somewhat exaggerated fashion. Benefits of the Movie:     This film will help teach children about the constitutional roles of the President, the Senate, and the military. It can also be used as a platform to discuss the intense opposition to the government from certain elements in the political right wing during the Cold War. Possible Problems:     MINOR. Most characters in this film drink alcohol and smoke. Parenting Points:     The novel and ultimately the movie was created when, as the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. took limited steps to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, right wing ideologues began making irresponsible statements that, if put into practice, would inevitably lead to the destruction of the government. The novelist decided to take them at their word and build on what would happen if they acted on what they said. Before watching the film review the Helpful Background section.

332,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/shiloh.html,"Marty is eleven years old and lives in the mountains of West Virginia. He develops an attachment to a beagle hunting dog who has twice run away from an abusive owner. Marty names the dog Shiloh and desperately tries to find a way to keep him. These efforts lead Marty to secrets, lies and confusion over right and wrong. Instead of returning the dog to his owner, Marty hides Shiloh in an old shed and lies to everyone when asked if he has seen the dog. Although Marty's family is on a tight budget and his father has said that they can't afford to feed a dog, Marty sneaks food to Shiloh. The shed does not provide Shiloh with adequate protection. One night, Shiloh is badly mauled by a much larger dog and Marty's lies are exposed. However, through an unexpected stroke of luck, combined with courage, perseverance, and hard work, Marty eventually convinces the once abusive owner to sell him the dog. Unfortunately, this also requires that Marty lie one more time to his parents. Benefits of the Movie:     The film can serve as a treat or reward after students have read the novel. The Possible Problems section will discuss how to turn the substantial problems with the story (both the book and the movie) into a strength.

There are major problems with the book and the movie. In both, Marty repeatedly rationalizes lying to serve his own interests. One of the lies is made to his parents at the request of an adult. It is extremely dangerous for children to lie to their parents at the behest of another adult. (The novel won the Newberry Award. TWM cannot understand why this award was given to a book whose hero accomplishes his goals by lying.) A second and less important problem is that the story shows mountain people in West Virginia defying the laws concerning hunting and cruelty to animals. Adults suggesting the book or the movie should take the time to turn the story's substantial problems with lying into strengths. Benefits can be found in pondering the great value of honesty and the special dangers to children when they lie to parents at the request of another adult. As to the value of honesty, the question comes down to whether being honest would result in the sacrifice of a greater good. Good cause or bad, a lie is a lie. Only in extreme circumstances, when the good to be achieved is important and the lie is the only way to secure that good, can an ethical person lie. In addition, when the lie will benefit the liar, one must be careful of making rationalizations to justify the result desired. A person in Marty's position had to make an objective determination that the good to be achieved, without his own interests being considered, justified the lie. Specifically, before Marty could justify lying about Shiloh's whereabouts he had to make sure that the benefit to Shiloh was sufficient to permit an ethical lie and that the only effective way to protect Shiloh was for Marty to keep him. A good argument can be made that in the circumstances of this story, the only way to protect Shiloh was for Marty to become his master. However, when a person lies, he or she takes responsibility for the situation. In this story, Marty got in over his head because he didn't have the resources to protect Shiloh during the night. As a result, Shiloh was attacked by a larger dog and suffered injuries that Judd Travers contended he would never have inflicted. As for the last lie that Marty tells, the lie to his parents about why Judd Travers changed his mind and let Marty buy the dog, Marty clearly makes the wrong decision. The risks of lying to parents at the request of another adult are obvious, as demonstrated by the plight of the millions of children who have been sexually abused and then at the demand of the abuser, withhold the information from their parents, permitting the abuse to continue. Most kids cannot compete in experience or cunning with an adult who tries to induce them to lie to their parents. Children should be cautioned that when an adult asks them to keep something secret or to lie to their parents, the adult is usually doing something wrong. The request alone makes it very important for the children to tell their parents. The fact that the resolution of ""Shiloh"" involves Marty withholding information and lying to his parents at the request of Judd Travers makes it important that adults who offer the book or the movie to children stress this point.

336,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/small-wonders.html," This documentary entrances and inspires music students ages 6 - 16, by showing children their own age anxious to play the violin, willing to practice, and willing to work hard to live up to their teacher's stringent standards. The setting is the New York City School system in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As in many parts of the country, public schools are being forced to drastically reduce spending on arts and music education. Roberta Guaspari has created an innovative violin program at three elementary schools in East Harlem. When funding cuts force the school board to eliminate her program, she doesn't accept her fate and fade away. Instead, Ms. Guaspari, the parents of her students, other teachers, and public minded citizens create their own nonprofit foundation so that instruction in the violin can continue. To raise money for the program, the parents and their allies organize a concert at Carnegie Hall in which masters such as Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman, Arnold Steinhardt, and country fiddler Mark O'Connor, perform alongside the young students. ""Small Wonders"" documents this story and shows violin students as young as six years of age practicing, taking class and performing. ",,"Watching this film will help children who play musical instruments acquire the discipline to practice. It will make them aware that there are millions of young people throughout the world working hard, learning to play musical instruments. ""Small Wonders"" may inspire children to take up a musical instrument. Older children (and adults) will benefit from watching caring and nurturing inner city schools in action and an inspiring teacher.

Director: Allen Miller and Lana Miller. Helpful Background: The film features vignettes of educators and parents talking about Ms. Guaspari's program and arts education in general. The East Harlem Violin Program has expanded to three violin teachers and one cello instructor. Its student body is 36% African American and 60% Latino. Many of its students continue their music study in the Interschool Orchestras of New York, the Julliard School of Music Advancement Program, and the Harlem Schools for the Arts. In addition to Carnegie Hall, the students from this program have performed at the White House, the Kennedy Center, in Germany, Switzerland, and many other locations. Demand for the program still exceeds the space available and the lottery is still used to select students. 50% of the applicants are turned away. What began as an effort to protect the job of an innovative and inspiring teacher is now a nonprofit organization with broader goals. Opus 118 - We Want Music! has plans that include promoting outstanding teaching efforts in other New York City schools, offering after school and weekend lessons to dedicated students, and a concert series to expose students to great musical performers. Its ""Outstanding String Teachers Initiative"" seeks to train music teachers in the group teaching methodology pioneered by Roberta Guaspari, along with developing skills in program development, community-parent organization, relations with elected officials, and public-private interaction. Opus 118 - We Want Music! has proposed several other initiatives designed to promote music education nationally. Roberta Guaspari studied violin in the public schools and went on to major in Music Education in college. She holds a Masters Degree in Music Education from Boston University. She is now Artistic Director of Opus 118 - We Want Music! New York City's Carnegie Hall is acclaimed as the world's most prestigious concert hall. ""Its walls have echoed with applause for the world's outstanding classical artists, as they have for the greatest popular musicians of our time and for the many prominent dancers, politicians, authors and crusaders who have appeared on its stage."" Financed by industrial tycoon Andrew Carnegie, who foresaw its great legacy, Carnegie Hall was completed in 1891. It is ""an embodiment of the aspirations of all those who have striven, on both sides of the footlights, to sustain our musical culture and convey it to future generations."" A performance at Carnegie Hall is considered the high point of a concert artist's career.

Many murders and several beatings are shown but there is little graphic violence. Usually the camera pans away and you hear the gunshot. Alcohol use and abuse and smoking are shown.

SUGGESTIONS FOR USING STAND AND DELIVER IN THE CLASSROOM Introduction Before showing the movie, tell students that the story of movie is pretty much true except in a few respects that you'll tell them about at the end of the movie. Tell students to watch how one of the characters, a boy named ""Angel"" dresses. What are the moviemakers trying to tell us about him through his clothing? Post-Viewing Comments When the movie is over, tell students that: (1) Mr. Escalante worked for six years before the breakthrough 1982 test in which 18 Garfield High students demonstrated that they had mastered calculus. He started by encouraging area middle schools to offer algebra in their eighth and ninth grades to help students acquire the background necessary to understand calculus. He taught summer school for student who wanted to upgrade their math skills. (2) There is strong evidence that the students did cheat. Twelve of them used an identical incorrect formula for the one of the problems and also made an identical mathematical error while simplifying a fraction, a task they had performed successfully thousands of times before. In interviews years later with a journalist, two of the students admitted that there was cheating on that one particular question, but later withdrew their admissions. However, they did know their calculus because a few months later, when they were tested again, under strict scrutiny, and they all passed. Teachers may want to have students read TWM's Stand and Deliver Handout (.doc) as homework after seeing the movie. Jaime Escalante",Stand and Deliver,353,6305161917

""Scenes humorous, scenes tender, scenes terrifying, each with a definite purpose and value, blended so delicately with the original, created the illusion that these were [my] words.""

Many countries were forced to become colonies of Imperialist powers. Westerners had forced China to grant them trading concessions. England addicted millions of Chinese to opium (a drug which the British controlled) in order to pay for the tea which the British people bought in huge quantities. The United States participated in seeking trading concessions to a small degree and held the Philippines as a colony, having won it from Spain in the Spanish-American war. Japan claimed that its aggression in Asia was for the purpose of kicking out the Western powers. In reality, the Japanese sought to replace the Western powers as an imperialist presence in Asia. In 1937, after having conquered Manchuria, Japan invaded China. By December 1941, public opinion in the U.S. had turned against Japan because of Japan's alliance with Germany, the atrocities committed by Japanese troops against Chinese civilians, and the threat posed by Japanese expansionism to U.S. interests. There was, however, no overwhelming desire among the American people to go to war with Japan.",Tora! Tora! Tora!,371,B000EHSVSC

369,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/turning-point.html,"A detailed description of the plot of the film is necessary for parents and teachers to evaluate its suitability as a teaching tool. As the film begins, we learn that seventeen years earlier, Deedee (Shirley MacLaine), was a rising star with a major New York City dance company. When she became pregnant by one of the male dancers, they married, moved to Oklahoma, started a dance school, and had three children. The marriage is a happy one. Deedee's friend and rival, Emma (Anne Bancroft) stayed in New York and became the prima ballerina of the company. The action of the movie begins when the dance company, with Emma still its reigning ballerina, visits the town in which Deedee and her family live. Deedee has a party for the company, seeing Emma again for the first time in years. Deedee's sixteen year old daughter, Emilia, is allowed to take dance classes with the company. She dances so well that she is offered admission to the company ballet school. Deedee's son, about age 12, is having trouble choosing between ballet and baseball. At her husband's suggestion, Deedee takes Emilia and the boy to New York City to spend a summer taking intensive dance classes. They stay with Alexandra Danilova, the great prima ballerina, essentially playing herself. Now elderly, she coaches ballerinas and takes in boarders to make ends meet. In the company ballet school Emilia shines and she is given a principal role in a summer performance. Emilia, Deedee and Emma each have a major crisis during the course of the summer. Deedee is doubting her decision to abandon her career as a ballerina and concentrate on her family. Treated as just another parent at the company ballet school, she feels very much on the outside. She meets and has an affair with an old flame. Emilia meets Yuri, a famous dancer from Russia. (Yuri is Mikhail Baryshnikov playing himself; we are shown scenes of the company, including Baryshnikov, in class.) Yuri soon romances Emilia. They have a short affair which ends when Emilia sees Yuri and another ballerina kissing in a dressing room. Emilia also discovers that her mother is staying out all night. (How could she miss it? Mother and daughter sleep in the same room at Danilova's.) Emilia, naturally, is upset by her mother's infidelity as well as Yuri's shallowness. Emma is in crisis because younger dancers are being selected for the ballets that in the past had been her domain. Her lover, who in years past had offered to divorce his wife and marry her, gets cold feet when she hints that she might finally be receptive to a proposal. All the frustration and the years of pent-up jealousy between Deedee and Emma culminate in a comic fight in cocktail dresses outside of Lincoln Center. Deedee's husband comes to town and she realizes how lucky she is to have him. Emma begins to focus on being a mentor to Emilia. Everyone lives happily enough ever after, knowing that if you are going to give your life to performance and artistry, there will be great sacrifices.",,"This film shows fabulous dancing, the unremitting hard work demanded of a dancer, some of the inner workings of a major ballet company, the internal rivalries in a dance company, and the changing of the guard imposed by the aging of a prima ballerina. After this film was released, there was a flood of thousands of boys into dance schools across the nation. The movie explores the benefits and costs of a life led in pursuit of art and fame as opposed to a life concentrating on family and interpersonal relationships. In today's world, some ballerinas have families while they perform; but it is still difficult. The film shows that parents aren't perfect and sometimes need forgiveness from their children. The movie also explores issues of sexual fidelity and attraction. Deedee's husband is not a major figure in the film but he is consistently supportive and nurturing to all members of his family. There is a tastefully and beautifully choreographed scene of Emilia's first lovemaking with Yuri. It is soft edged and not graphic.","SERIOUS, BUT THEY CAN BE TURNED INTO BENEFITS. The plot of this film involves marital infidelity and sexual promiscuity. We showed this film to one of our sons when he was 11 years of age because of his strong interest in ballet. Before it started, his father took him aside and told him that there were problems with the way in which Deedee, Yuri and Emilia acted with regard to romance and sex. He talked a little about what we felt was appropriate. As shown from the description above, there are several other problems with the film. Deedee is going through a stage in which she is absorbed in finally reconciling her decision, some seventeen years earlier, to give up dance and raise a family. Her self-absorption causes her to miss an important opportunity to counsel Emilia about her relationship with Yuri. In addition, Deedee has an affair and does not conceal it from her daughter. Emilia is level headed and strong and she eventually forgives her mother. This situation rings true and can be turned into an important lesson for children that parents are not always perfect. (Parents beware, if you discuss this issue, some children will ask whether you've ever had an affair. Have your answer ready in advance.) Deedee's affair was certainly not appropriate behavior. It was primarily motivated by the emotions aroused by her return to NYC and rethinking her decision to have children and get married. The affair is not particularly important to her and ends by simply stopping, as many affairs do, when the underlying problem is solved. Moreover, Deedee's husband comes to New York and she realizes that he is the one that she really loves. Emilia, after she learns that she is just another one of Yuri's easy conquests, gets drunk and appears for a performance barely able to stand. This is a function, as much as anything else, of her discovery of her mother's affair and the fact that she had no one to talk with about her problems. After this one misstep, and when she can finally talk to Emma about the situation with Yuri, Emilia moves on, forgives her mother and can dance with Yuri with equanimity. In this she shows real strength of character. Parenting Points:     Before watching the movie tell your child that you have problems with the way in which Deedee, Yuri and Emilia acted with regard to romance and sex. After the movie talk a little about how what they did was not appropriate. With some children, a good way to start is to ask them what they thought about how these characters behaved. Then ask and help your child to answer the Quick Discussion Question. Finally, perhaps another day at dinner or in the car going to school, ask and help your child answer Social-Emotional Learning Discussion Question #13.",,"LEARNING GUIDE TO: THE TURNING POINT SUBJECTS — Dance; U.S./1945 - 1991; SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL LEARNING — Marriage; Mother/Daughter; Friendship;         Male Role Model; Work/Career; Talent; MORAL-ETHICAL EMPHASIS --- Responsibility.

Helpful Background:     The first of the issues on evolution that will be addressed in this lesson plan is the timescale of species change. Human evolution is commonly understood as beginning 2.5 millions of years ago with the appearance of the Homo Habilis, the first beings considered as belonging to the genus homo, within which we (Homo Sapiens Sapiens) are a subspecies of the species Homo Sapiens. For example, Homo Neandethalensis (Neanderthal Man) is a different species of Homo Sapiens. The distribution of a trait throughout a population of a particular species has usually also required extremely long timescales, but there are several interesting instances of distinct evolution having been observed in the time lapse of short-term scientific observations. One of the quickest evolutions on record is the case of the Tropical Blue Moon Butterfly. (Click here for a picture to show to the class.) The butterflies carry a parasitic bacteria that was killing most male embryos before they hatched, reducing the male population from 50% to a mere 1% of the total. Due to a mutation, the genetic information of the butterfly started to include a gene that allowed the butterflies to produce an anti-bacterial chemical or somehow keep the bacteria in check. This led to a larger proportion of males carrying this gene and a rapid spread of the gene in successive generations of butterflies. The male population is now back to almost half of all specimens. Butterfly shows evolution at work from the BBC News, July 12, 2007) and But Madame Butterfly,Where are all the Males? by Sourish Basu, Scientific American, July 13, 2007. There are also observations indicating that there has been a noticeable change in the size of adult fish due to man-induced selection. Regulations limit the size of the fish that may be caught. Smaller fish must be left in the sea or thrown back, which allows smaller adults an opportunity to breed. It is considered a possibility that the catching of the larger fish of highly consumed species is inducing an evolutionary pattern towards a smaller adult size. See Human-induced evolution caused by unnatural selection through harvest of wild animals Fred W. Allendorf and Jeffrey J. Hard, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States). Some call this ""unnatural"", human-induced selection. But hasn't it always been true that a dominant species could affect the environment, and therefore the natural selection, of other species? Most mutations do not result in changes that are beneficial to the individual and the individual dies before birth, leading to a miscarriage, or if it lives, it will not have offspring and the mutation will die out. However, if the change caused by the mutation is one of the few that gives the individual an advantage in relation to the environment in which it lives, the individual may be more successful in leaving offspring ? now with the mutated gene, which in turn produce a new group of organisms that are more apt to survive. If the advantage is great enough, over what is usually a long period of time, most members of the species will come to have that mutation. Strictly speaking it cannot be said that a particular species has ""developed"" a new feature. Rather, the competition for survival has selected those individuals that are more fit through a process called natural selection. Since the environment is always changing, what is beneficial is always changing as well. An interesting example of the interplay between environment and natural selection has been the recent acquisition by human beings of the ability of adults to digest milk. In most animals, and in all human beings who lived more than 9,000 years ago, the ability to digest milk was for the young. It switched off in adulthood. In early hunter, gatherer societies, the only milk an individual would need would be the breast milk provided by the mother. But then, about 9,000 years ago people domesticated cattle. Once cattle were domesticated and formed an important source of food, being able to keep digesting milk increased the available food supply for those adults who carried the trait. Those adults obtained an advantage in natural selection. The evolutionary trait of the ability by an adult to digest milk is especially interesting because it is a significant example of convergent evolution which occurs when different populations independently acquire the same new feature through evolution; over the last 6,000 years, the ability to digest milk by adults has been found to have appeared at least once in Europe and an additional three separate times in Africa. At the time these changes were taking place another recent evolutionary development occurred. Between 10,000 and 6,000 years ago some human beings started to have blue eyes. Before that time everyone had brown colored eyes. This change has two interesting features worth noting: it is traceable to a single ancestor of all blue-eyed humans and scientists cannot figure out how the trait provides an evolutionary advantage to people who have it. There are other hereditary traits for which scientists have not found an evolutionary advantage. These include hair color, baldness, freckles and beauty spots. Even if there was no advantage conferred by these traits, natural selection played a role in their spread through the population because they are not disadvantageous. Professor Eiberg, one of the scientists who discovered that the mutation for blue eyes probably came from a single ancestor said, ""it simply shows that nature is constantly shuffling the human genome, creating a genetic cocktail of human chromosomes and trying out different changes as it does so."" It has been suggested by some scientists that human evolution has come to a halt. In modern civilized society many individuals who would have quickly perished if we had been living in the wild survive and have children. No genes are lost or gained due to natural selection as we fight to cure genetically induced diseases or defects. This issue is under debate within the scientific community and many articles and opinions can be found on either side. Some of the major points in this debate are as follows. The main argument in favor of human evolution having come to a halt is that the pressure by natural selection has all but vanished, allowing anyone, not only the most fit, to survive and have children. No ""disadvantageous"" genes are lost. More subtly, it is argued that there is no room for further improvements in the human species, after medical and biological research have made it relatively easy to live into the child bearing years. Also the increased mixing of genes due to the fact that in modern societies people meet and have children with partners from all over the world is said to produce a gene blending that blocks evolutionary changes. It is argued that this blending will end up making all humans of the planet more uniform, beginning with skin color, which is expected to become equally brown for all humans in a few generations. Monogamy has also been considered an obstacle for evolution. In an animal herd the fittest male would be father to a significantly large fraction of the offspring of all females. In addition, weaker females will die whereas stronger females will live longer and thus have much more offspring from those fittest males. In cultures that practice monogamy, no matter how genetically superior a male or female might be, the number of children will be limited. Others see human evolution limited to the mind ? perhaps better prepared humans to live in a profit and technology driven society are more likely to have children (because of their extra wealth), and the underlying genes ? if this is a matter of genes at all ? will spread faster. Yet others affirm that the wealthier and the professional class actually have fewer children than families in poverty and that the society will get less intelligent as a result. A final argument that natural selection is no longer a force in developed societies is the is that it will move into areas of genetic preference. There are sperm banks that describe the donor's occupation and personality traits. See e.g. International Cryogenics - Donor List and Fertility Cryobank - Sperm Donor Profiles. In the future, scientists may be able to manipulate genes so that certain traits are enhanced or suppressed. But if people are selecting for the traits that they feel will benefit their children in society, isn't this a form of natural selection? After all, haven't people been choosing mates for similar reasons for thousands of years? Against the argument that human evolution has stopped it is argued that natural selection has not necessarily stopped for humans: environmental issues like increased UV radiation on the surface of the Earth due to the hole in the ozone layer could still select against those less prepared to endure the resulting altered conditions. Each individual might be looked after, but as a whole, communities with higher death rates due to, for example, melanoma (skin cancer) are less likely to have descendants. In third world areas there is still a high degree of mortality and therefore an evolutionary pressure that favors those more resistant to malnutrition, AIDS, malaria or other diseases that prevail due to poverty or geographic location. A further argument points towards natural selection acting all the time but mostly going unnoticed because the effects on one individual are tiny. These effects would only become evident over generations. It is estimated that every human carries about two mutations with respect to the parent?s genetic code. Only very few are patently visible as diseases or dramatic changes in appearance: most of them might affect an individual?s capability to reproduce by a small percent. On the long run, however, it is argued, such genes do disappear (if they affect reproduction negatively) of spread (if they are positive for reproduction). Finally, there is a middle ground position, acknowledging the validity of all the arguments as describing forces which affect natural selection in the modern world. In this view, natural selection continues but is being affected by the vast changes that technology and advanced forms of social organization have made in modern society.",The Time Machine,384,B0045HCJSA

Age: 8+; MPAA Rating: PG; Drama; 86 minutes; Color; Available from Amazon.com. TWM does NOT recommend showing this film to children. It trivializes personal interactions, shows a child, in effect, being rewarded for lying to his parents, and is devoid of respect for animal life, other than for the dogs who serve the economic and entertainment needs of their owners. One of the low points of the story occurs after the child protagonist, Billy Coleman, has promised his dogs that he will kill the first raccoon they tree. The technique is to chop down the tree once the raccoon takes refuge in its branches. The first raccoon takes refuge in a magnificent tree, one of the largest in the woods. Young Billy, after trying manfully, cannot chop it down. His own efforts frustrated, he resorts to prayer and God obligingly sends a microwind to knock down the tree and allow Billy to kill the hapless raccoon. It demeans the concept of religion to tell children that God will destroy a beautiful tree so that a ten-year-old can keep a promise to his dogs and kill a racccoon, a magnificent creature in its own right. If the book is required as a part of the school's curriculum and if students have already read it, the movie might be of benefit to show young people how words are shifted into visual images and how adaptations change significant details. However, there are many other excellent filmed adaptations of novels that can show this. Some are suggested on TWM's Adaptations Index. Because of the movie's lack of artistic merit, it is not recommended as a reward film. The information and cautions in this Guide relate to BOTH THE BOOK AND THE MOVIE. The Guide does not attempt to provide materials sufficient for a full lesson plan based on the novel many of which are available on the Internet.

He and his Russian Wife (Isabella Rossellini) are ordered by the KGB to take Rodchenko in, watch him, and convince him to dance again in the Soviet Union. ",,"This movie explores the role of an artist in a totalitarian society and during the Cold War. It shows the little known phenomenon of African Americans defecting to the Soviet Union to try to find a society free from racism. It contains beautiful modern dance and tap sequences. The movie contains a fascinating episode about racism, Russian style. Greenwood and his wife have a biracial marriage and are deeply attached to one another. The KGB Colonel in charge of the operation is a racist. To put pressure on Greenwood to watch Rodchenko more carefully, the KGB takes Greenwood's wife away from him. In a ruse to get the KGB to return the woman, Rodchenko thanks the KGB Colonel for removing her, pretending to be disgusted at seeing a white woman married to a black man. He leads the KGB Colonel into a discussion of racist prejudices about sexual attraction between whites and blacks. The ruse works, the wife is returned (in an effort to increase the pressure on Rodchenko) and the couple is overjoyed. This incident is the first step in the development of trust between Rodchenko and Greenwood, which leads to the resolution at the end of the movie. The episode allows us to look at racism as an outsider and, in the process, learn about racism in ourselves and our society.","MODERATE. Roland Petit's ballet ""The Young Man and Death"" is featured at the beginning of this film. While the dance is beautiful, it involves a portrayal of suicide by hanging. This scene should be used as an opportunity to explain the dangers of playing with ropes or scarves around one's neck and the permanent nature of suicide. There is no graphic violence, but Greenwood is slapped once by his wife and there is a brief punching match between Rodchenko and Greenwood which resolves into a type of embrace. There is a moderate amount of profanity in the movie and most four letter words are used at least once. Rodchenko smokes and drinks, but not to excess. Excessive consumption of vodka is shown in a negative light through other characters, including Greenwood. Parenting Points:     This film will be great for children interested in the arts or in politics, history or political intrigue. See the Helpful Background section. Be sure to discuss with your child the dangers of playing with ropes or scarves around their neck. Immediately after the movie, or at odd times over the next week (for example at the dinner table or in the car on the way to school) bring up the Quick Discussion Question and at least the following: Discussion Questions 2 & 4; Social-Emotional Learning Discussion Question #1; and Moral/Ethical Emphasis Questions 1 & 2.

391,http://www.teachwithmovies.org/guides/witness.html,"""The Witness"" is an award-winning documentary about personal transformation and caring for animals. Eddie Lama, a street wise Brooklyn contractor, takes viewers inside his personal odyssey from animal avoider to animal protector — and then to vegetarian and crusader against the cruelties of the fur industry. It all began when a woman he wanted to date asked him to petsit her cat for the weekend. Eddie Lama is an articulate narrator who speaks from the heart. He tells his story with self-deprecating humor. Mr. Lama's love for animals radiates from the screen and envelopes the audience. The final scenes show Mr. Lama driving a van, outfitted with a large screen TV, playing video clips of the abuse of animals in the fur industry. He parks the van in front of high fashion New York City stores that sell fur. The scenes of animal abuse and the compassionate reactions of the by-standers are riveting. ""The Witness"" is recommended by the American Library Association and has been favorably reviewed in the Library Journal. It has been recommended by officials of the United Federation of Teachers and the California Teachers Association. See ""The Witness"" for Teachers and Librarians. Mr. Lama has received the Courage of Conscience Award for his efforts on behalf of animals. Mr. Lama's condemnation of the fur industry is consistent with charges made against the industry by mainstream animal welfare organizations, such as the Humane Society of the United States. See Caged Fur, the Inside Story.",,"""The Witness"" is an engrossing story of the capacity for emotional and moral growth that all people possess. This movie is appropriate for English Language Arts classes for two additional reasons: (1) it will drive writing and other skills-based assignments; and (2) it will facilitate critical thinking and self-awareness. This film is an excellent vehicle for awakening students to the fact that our actions have implications for animals that we need to take into account. This is a generally held value in society and therefore suitable to be taught in public schools, although most people would not give concerns for animals as high a priority as Mr. Lama. See Possible Problems section below. ""The Witness"" is also an excellent introduction to the animal rights movement, which gains adherents daily and which is an increasingly vocal part of society's current debate about ethics. The fur industry provides a convenient and relatively non-controversial topic through which to acquaint students with the basic arguments for animal rights. See Possible Problems section below. Possible Problems:     MODERATE. The movie contains a scene briefly showing a skinned carcass of an animal killed for its fur and a few short scenes of animals being brutally killed. Similar incidents occur daily in fur ""farms"" and animal markets throughout the world. People need to be well informed if they are to make morally correct choices. In a society in which advertisers spend millions trying to convince consumers to buy a coat made of fur or a jacket trimmed with fur, students need to know the consequences of these purchases. Mr. Lama's concern for animals has not only caused him to mount a crusade against the fur industry, he also refrains from eating meat and consuming dairy products. When discussing the animal rights aspects of this film, teachers in public schools should not advocate for Mr. Lama's ideas, no matter how much they might agree with them. (Note that the authors of this Guide do agree with Mr. Lama's positions and have themselves adopted a vegan lifestyle based on ethical reasons.) Lessons in ethics and morality in public schools should be confined to those on which society has reached a consensus. Ethical veganism is still a minority position, although it gains adherents each year. Most people eat meat and consume dairy products without a thought to the pain and death inherent in the factory farming system. Most people who purchase furs don't think about the caged lives and horrific deaths of the animals who will be draped across their backs. Moreover, it is generally accepted that ethical considerations in eating and dress are the province of a child's family. This is not to say that the arguments of the animal rights movement should not be discussed in schools, public or private. It is a legitimate function for a teacher to expose students to the world in which they live and the discussions about ethics that are taking place in society. Any discussion of vegan or vegetarian ethics or the ethics of wearing fur or making fur clothing should take place within that context. (Note also that there are several factors inherent in the choice of food which argue for eating less meat or no meat at all and which are appropriate for advocacy in public schools because they are based on generally accepted facts and consensus values. These include: (1) personal and public health; (2) the fact that the meat industry is one of the worst polluters on the planet; and (3) consumption of meat contributes to food shortages and starvation.
